Some simple measures and systems are suggested which if introduced will go a long way towards improving the quality of the environment in these communities. The author concludes that the achievement of the objective depends much on the simplicity of the system and their effective management."

It will reiterate the importance of involving the people in the planning and imple­mentation of projects. It will suggest that the present surge of interest in appropriate technology requires appropriate staff and that this in turn will require the replacement of much of present education by education for less prestigious schemes. Finally, it will survey the role adult education can play."

type are generally built to remove turbidity from raw water. Turbidity in excess of the acceptable limits is found in surface sources as rivers and reservoirs. Ground water turbidity has been found always within the acceptable limits; accordingly, no clarification treatment is needed. Some cities have built their treatment plants with its surface water treatment units to receive groundwater of very low turbidity. When it becomes exposed to the atmosphere, algae breeding takes place due to the presence of high material content, low turbidity, and exposure to light. Consequently, algae troubles as taste, odour, and filter clogging take place too. All such troubles and others relevant to the presence of algae could have been completely avoided if the raw water from the ground source bypassed the treatment plant and joined directly the clear water reservoir for disinfection, if needed, and then distribution directly. No technical reason is known to build a surface water treatment plant for a groundwater source. This is confirmed by results shown in table (1), and (2) for Geita spring water which is considered the main source of supply for the city of Beirut. As a result of a survey carried out in Lebanon where groundwater is introduced to clarification units, it can be stated safely that no need for clarification since the groundwater turbidity has been always found within the international acceptable limits."

The great mass of industry and population creates pollution at a scale we are now not capable of handling. Even the monitoring of sources of pollution is beyond our present capabilities. The monitoring is the first step in pollution control and it can be accomplished by carefully designed remote sensing system. The feasibility of employing this technique in monitoring water pollution is indicated in this paper."

Hundreds of people die every year because they had inadequate water or sanitation facilities. Thousands 
of people spend half their day walking in the hot sun to carry polluted water which will poison them and their families. Future rural water supplies have to project for a fifty year period, and a second thirty year period. This plan has to take into consideration the rapidly increasing water demands, quantitative and qualitative modification of the present water resources. The planning comprised (1) valuation of the competitions and gathering useable solutions, (2) analysis of solution variations and the possibility of combining part solutions and (3) economic evaluation and election of optimal project variations. A model of linear programming was prepared for each independent district, which were con­sidered as basic models. These models con­tained continuous decisive variables, possible water supply solutions or their variables. Investment variables and quantity of water supplied to the users, operation variables, (dimensions cubic metres per day) were also considered. The cost sensibility of the solution was worked out along with the result of variation of the 12% discount factor, the effects of the modifications of resource demand structure, and the inter-relation between the districts considered as independ­ent. The sum of the investment costs together with the maintenance and 12% discount factor was kept minimal."

The problem is further accentuated by the constant drift of rural dwellers to the few urban centres in search of jobs and other opportuni­ties offered by urbanization. Urbanization and its concomitant housing problems have created the situation where urban slums have become a regular feature of most urban centres. High population density, temporary structures used as living quarters and lack of proper sanitation are conspi­cuous features of these slums. The predominant method of excreta collection known to these slum dwellers is the night soil system. This paper examines some popular methods of excreta collection and puts forward another possible method of excreta management in high density urban slums."

Contractors are not constrained by govern­ment regulations and can often, for example, use alternative methods to obtain materials in short supply, or pay incentive wages to the labour force for work not just atten­dance. A self help construction project is likely to be successful in a rural environ where the community is united under a central figure -the village elder. But the fight to survive in an urban habitat often results in mater­ials being sold for more important things such as food and medicine, and not the construction of the latrine.

An ecological study of the ponds, with an eco­-system approach, therefore becomes relevant. In the present study it was found that the maximum production in pond is achieved between 0800 and 1100 Hours; the respiration is maximum in the afternoon reaching its lowest value in the morning corresponding to a minimum temperature. Minimum DO levels were recorded at around 0300 Hours, reaching near saturation value. The algae in the log phase of growth were found 
a shade faster than that in the decay phase in starting the production and reaching to its peak value. The pH of the pond waters were found to rise with production moving into alkaline range and as such it can be an index of productivity in an aquatic ecosystem."

professionals in specialised fields is an expensive programme. It is even more 
expensive in developing countries where shortages and lack of well qualified teachers, training materials, teaching 
aids and equipment are not available. Tanzania like any other developing country was faced with shortage of engineers and other professionals when it became independent in 1961. In 1970 when the country had decided to launch a massive programme of trying to provide clean and potable water to her people by the year 1991 the situation with engineers available in the Ministry had not changed very much. This paper therefore attempts to explain how the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals (MWEM) achieved this programme by launching a crush training programme of training engineers outside the country. It gives an account of how the idea was conceived and explains how financial support was obtained from Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)."

A wider variety of onsite system designs are available for treatment of surface water. The type of treatment systems built often reflect the experience and preference of the designer. The various criteria for selection are public health considerations, cost, ease of operating and maintaining the treatment system. This introduces the necessity to initiate and follow up organised studies on novel water treatment techniques at a level that could be considered well within the scope of technical and equipment resources of the developing countries.

The largest concentrations of the latrines are in the low cost sites and services areas of Katlehong and Khubetsoana. These latrines have also been promoted widely by the Urban Sanitation Improvement Team (USIT) in the rest of the peri-urban area and many rural people have opted for this type of latrine and constructed it with help either from USIT or the Rural Sanitation Project (RSP). Because of the ingress of groundwater in many of these latrines, it has not been possible to achieve complete separation of the contents of the two pits and cross-contamination has been evident in many of them. USIT has therefore been led to re-consider further promotion of this type of latrine."

The work reported has concentrated upon the development of a low cost 3-litre flush volume w.c. suitable for use in developing countries and has been funded by the UK Overseas Development Ad­ministration (ODA). This paper presents the team's approach to the problem of low water use w.c. design, in terms of the modifiable variables such as trap volume, water seal depth, cistern to bowl water distribution etc. Laboratory trials are reported to support the design decisions taken in respect of trap seal depth and volume. In order to both reduce bowl cost and provide the bowl with a pour flush capability, the bowl is rimless. The solution to the water discharge to the bowl and subsequent surface cleansing problem chosen is a water spreading nozzle connected directly to the cistern discharge and posi­tioned at the rear of the bowl. Development of this ""spreader bar"" flow device is reported. Site evaluation in Botswana and Lesotho during 1985 and 1986 is also discussed."

The high cost of the conventional roads has not been very contributive. Many areas are still being served with graded latrite roads or none at all. Laterite road is notorious for being dusty during the dry seasons, causing accumulation of undesirable blanket of dust on to houses and vegetations. The dust may also have a serious effect on health. Forma­tion of deep ruts which are unpassable to vehicles at times is a common occurance in the wet seasons. Thus a high cost is incurred if the roads are to be maintained. The paper intends to present the works car­ried out at the University Pertanian Malaysia on the stabilization of lateritic soils using cement to act both as the road base and surfacing. The works include conducting basic soil mechanics tests on the soil-cement mix­ture and evaluating the effect of additives such as sand and rice husk ash on strength. A field trial on the construction of the soil­cement road was also done to evaluate the weathering effect under exposure."

However modern knowledge of sci­ences and technology available at higher and lower institutions has proved that fo­rest products, when technically handled, can be developed to a technology of high­er standard and become substitute to many modern costly materials used in hydraulic engineering practice e.g. water pipes/tanks for water supply, water filters, irr­igation systems, sewage disposal, drainage, road culverts and food storage silos. For the past fourteen years, Tanzania has developed this technology very well in building up systems of water supply, irrigation, road culverts and food storage in many parts of the country. Some s­chemes has given constant service to the public for the period of more than twelve years without failure. The cost of the materials, construction and skill applie­d is very low and justifies the suitabi­lity as appropriate technology. Africa has plentful of these types of resources e.g. timber and bamboo forests. By taken into consideration the successfullness of this type of techniques in Ta­nzania, could turn to be important develo­pment for African Community as a whole. 
Many International Technical Conferences, including those organised by WEDC (Culcata India 1986) have accepted this technology as viable. 
This paper explains briefly about the technology in general and its achievemen­ts in Tanzania with possibility of exten­ding the technology to other countries."

This paper therefore provides a review of avai­lable groundwater information as well as the geological setting of South­western Nigeria. The degree of groun­dwater exploitation in each of the hydro-geological units in the study area is assessed in relation to their hydraulic characteristics. The results of the statistical analysis show that the behaviour of the borehole characteristics is erratic and unpredictable, and that generally the yields from the produ­ctive boreholes are very poor. The contribution of the geology of the area to this erratic behaviour and low yields is also discussed."

Despite of several unfavorable conditi­ons, as an irregular power supply, the initial unavailabiiity of trained opera­tors and programmers, and the frequent absence of a nearby maintenance, service and spare part supply, the presence of a microcomputer is considered as a tremen­dous advantage in the project. However, before ""computerizing"" a project, one should seriously consider the conse­quences of it. Once microcomputers are introduced, there is hardly a way back.

Water from these boreholes were analysed for bacteriological quality. A follow-up study assessed the household waters from villages that had been provided with boreholes after 6 months, 1 year and 2 years of post intervention. After 6 months of post intervention, 91.43% of the boreholes were bacteriologically 
satisfactory. Also, bacteriological 
results at 1 year and 2 years post inter­vention gave 80% and 85.72%, satisfaction respectively. It was found that provision of potable water alone to the rural communities, without adequate sanitation, continuous pre and post intervention health education, and protected fetching and storage containers may not achieve the level of success desired in dealing with water borne and water related diseases 
in rural Africa. Furthermore, the habits of the rural communities with respect to water use, personal hygiene and good sanitation may take years before a reasonable level of change could be achieved. Efforts of the health educators and other community workers must continue even when 
the people apparently remain adamant after a reasonable period of enlightenment. Government must be ready to pay the price of such high cost of continuous health education in the rural areas of African communities if good health for the people must be achieved. Finally, a package of water and sanitation project would go a long way in improving the health of the rural communities."

Sri Lanka is a small island with difficult socio-economic problems confronting its fifteen million inhabitants. Approximately 16% of the total population lives in urban areas and one half of the urban dwellers are without steady jobs and they live in old buildings or in unauthorised shanties. Sri Lankan government believes the
housing provides a key to the solution of many problems in the country and the sites and services programme was introduced in urban cities to provide the urban poor a buildable land with necessary services and a housing loan. The National Housing Development Authority of Sri Lanka is responsible for making the programme a success with minimum involvement of government and maximum commitment of the target communities. Benificiaries are given a plot of 50 meter square in size under this programme and it is the task of the engineers and planners to fit in all the services in this little space. 
The programme was launched in 1984 and the Housing Development Authority of 
Sri Lanka is proud to say that this was able to solve the urban housing problem to a greater extent and wide experience and knowledge gained through this and made the programme well improved. 
So far the lands and tne services had 
been given to the communities free of cost and now the strategies are being worked out to recover the costs involved from the beneficiaries."

The housing problems needs serious considerations. The housing situation in rural areas is still more grave because of neglection of rural housing over a period of years. 
Surveys made by the United Nations and the specialized agencies to acertain prev­ailing housing conditions in the world show with minor exceptions that they are so unsatisfactory that extraordinary steps must be taken within reasonable time in order to master the situation. It has been estimated that the present shortage of housing in the country is 34.7 million. At the present rate in increase in population of the country as well as the present rate of construc­tion of housing shortage will swell to 50 million dwellings by the year 2000. The yearly production of dwellings is presently estimated at 8 million. It would be possible technically to control the situation if, during the present decade, the production could be increased to an average of 12 million dwellings per year and thereafter for each decade be further accelerated so that between 1990 and 2000 the production will be about 25 million dwellings. This gigantic problem posses a serious challenge to planners and construction engineers to reduce construction costs and to use the limited resources in the most economical way. In this paper authors have made an attempt to discuss the factors influencing building cost and to put forward some appropriate techniques for reducing building cost for low cost rural housing so as to meet the evergrowing demand."

This is especially true in the fields of water supply and sanitation, squatter up-grading, irrigation and housing infrastructure. In spite of the advantages this shift has brought about, however, it has tended to highlight the difficulty in effective monitoring of any mini-projects spread over wide areas. In many circumstances, these projects have to be coordinated from a central point either at the agency's headquarters or at regional offices. The problem is how to access, update and analyse information about the performance of these projects both individually and collectively with a degree of reliability and speed for planning purposes.

two-year study on the pollutional effects of brewery wastewater on the Ruaraka River. As a preliminary investigation to an extensive river pollution study, samples were taken twice weekly between August 1988 and June 1990 from two sampling points immediately upstream and downstream of the point of discharge of the Tusker Brewery wastewater into the river. The samples were analysed for BOD and COD as well as other parameters. The results of this preliminary investigation showed that whilst the average BOD of the river water was about 6.9 mg/1 at the section just above the wastewater outfall, the average BOD of the river water at the sampling point immediately below the outfall was about 115.6 mg/1. Similarly, the average COD concentrations for the upstream and downstream sections were 34.7 mg/1 and 240.4 mg/1 respectively. If the brewery wastewater was treated in an anaerobic pond having only 45 per cent BOD reduction efficiency before discharge, it is estimated that the average BOD concentration of the river water at the downstream section would only be about 65mg/l. Treatability studies carried out on the wastewater showed that it would be possible to achieve a BOD reduction of 45 per cent or more in laboratory scale anaerobic pond units."

world can have experienced such profound 
changes as have occured in Ethiopia since the revolution in 1974. The economy of the country is still based on agriculture but the former feudal structure has been transformed by sweeping land reform which put the means of production more in the hands of peasant farmers. Coupled with this development were radical changes in local government, with up to 25,000 Peasant Associations being formed. With the formation of other mass organizations, the rural population is now highly politicized. The Government, following a Marxist-­Leninist line, has always stressed the involvement of the community in their own development. This has included the development of rural water supplies. Ethiopia has been pre-eminent in the region in establishing a Community Participation Promotion Service within the agency responsible for the maintenance of rural water services. However, a recent survey in the Southern Region found that 30% of rural waterpoints were not functioning, and that only half of the communities with improved water supplies had a water committee to manage improved water systems (ref.1). This paper focuses on the situation in the Southern Region and will seek to explain why many rural water supply systems have not been sustainable, despite the emphasis that the government places on community 
involvement. Measures now being implemented to increase sustainability through more active and pragmatic community participation and through the use of appropriate technology will also be discussed."

This wastewater has previously not been adequately treated prior to discharge to receiving waters with the 
result that these streams are highly 
polluted. Textile processing uses bleaches and dyes in large quantities and these create problems in the form of difficult effluents which are discharged from the works. This paper reports the results of investi­gations on the treatment of high strength  textile wastewaters by rotating biological 
contactors (RBC's) and Porous Pots. The 
effects of loading rate and disk media 
composition on organic removal rate were 
examined. The results show that comparatively, RBCs can treat high strength textile wastewaters better than porous pots. The resulting effluent organic content was adequate for discharge into either marine or freshwater receiving waters without fear of polluting these sources. Mean COD, BOD5, TOC removals of 80%, 71% and 60% respec­tively for the RBC and 69%, 60% and 50% respectively for the Porous Pot using a hydraulic loading rate of 0.08 m3/m2 day. At higher loading rates up to 0.30 m3/m2.day, the organic removal efficiency was reduced."

The configuration of structures in housing, the orientation and spatial arrangement maintain certain concepts in specific regions. It is a well known fact that built environments produce significant changes, so general design approach would differ from place to place. A critical appraisal of the changes on architectural concepts and planning of housing in Africa is presented with full illustration of past and present experience. Suitable form and function of most African low-cost design by present-day architects are becoming more and more relegated to the background. For example acute shortage of housing due to rapid urbanization has found solution in the concept of low-cost housing with the attendant negative effect of designs that are focused only on cost savings. Housing irrespective of low-cost or high-cost, should provide solutions of the built environment where interrelation­ship between people, socio-cultura, house and climate are well accommodated. The paper contains a comparative analysis of housing problems in time based on past and present design concepts, forms, func­tions, construction methods and materials in relation to the environment. The adverse consequences of present day technological innovations on low-cost housing design are documented and the paper concludes with proposed solutions and guidelines for low­cost housing."

Where the KSS is a genuine co-operative and the land in the incremental command area belongs to its members, gross margin analysis may capture the key variables in the decision to invest in a buried pipe system. Where narrower factional interest, dominate, the financial effects on operating cost, and the income from water charges are a better guide to the balance of incentive. A model of the financial effects of BP schemes on KSS finances has been developed, using typical operating costs and water charges and conveyance efficiencies. (The capital cost of the well is treated as a sunk cost and does not enter the calculations). Improvements in irrigation efficiency on the existing command area (CA) save pumping costs, but cannot alone justify a BP investment. The critical variables were the capital cost (chiefly determined by the length of buried pipe) and the incremental command area. Examples of this analysis will be given for a range of BP schemes, as will graphs of the relationship between incremental CA, rates of water charge and the financial viability of the scheme. Financial viability is defined here as the ability to meet full loan repayments in the first year. (This is rather a restrictive assumption due to the ""front-loading"" of instalments). Where the length of pipe is short relative to potential incremental CA, the returns from irrigation would be more than adequate to meet repayments if the full potential CA is irrigated. Experience suggests that this potential is not always attained; more investigation is required to find out why this is."

Water treatment plant design attempts to create conditions favourable for physico-chemical processes of purification. However plant operators often realise, long after installation, that some of the unit processes require modifications to facilitate efficient operation. While these process modifications may require additional expenses, the most beneficial changes often result in substantial savings in operational costs. Therefore simulation study of model plants could be a useful tool in performance evaluation and in assessing the impact of any required modifications to existing full-scale treatment plants. This paper report the results of a simulation model study of the Durban Heights Water Treatment Plant (DHWTP). A laboratory model of a typical water treatment plant was designed, constructed and installed at the University of Durban-Westville. Using the model to treat raw water from the Durban heights treatment plant intake, the performances of flocculation, coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection processes were evaluated based on results from routine analysis of samples of raw, post-sedimentation, pre-chlorination, and treated water. The results obtained were compared with data from the Durban heights water treatment plant and the paper concludes with useful recommendations that could enhance the efficiency of the treatment plant."

Laboratory studies were conducted to delineate the effect of parameters on uptake of Hexavalent Chromium and the kinetics of adsoprtion of cr+6 removal. Parameters evaluated include, pH, size of adsorbent, time of contact and initial adsorbate concentration. Equilibrium studies indicate that the process obeyed Langmuir isotherm. However, Freudlich isotherm was used to predict the ultimate sorption capacity. The results indicate that the pongamia pinnata shell can be very effectively, efficiently and economically used to remove Cr +6 from the industrial wastewaters in avidic range. (pH 2.0)"

Leakage through joints and pipe walls, averaged 0.9 leaks per 100m of pipeline, while 42% of outlet valves were observed to leak. Conveyance losses within the pipelines averaged 0.33 lps/100m by the tank test method and 0.69 lps/100m by inflow-outflow method, with earth channel losses averaging 7.69 lps/100m by the inflow-outflow method. Machine spun pipes performed better and ""plain end pipe jointing"" was found appropriate. Measured head losses for different pipe sizes and pump discharges were found com­patible with theoretical values when using the Colebrook­White Equation with Ks = 0.6 mm. Low pump discharge (60% of design), low periods of pump operation (12% of advised), small command areas (42% of intended) and low yields of irrigated crops were commonly observed. Sea­sonal repair and maintenance expenditure on pipeline sys­tems varied from Tk 4.64/ha to Tk. 127.19/ha, with the average of Tk. 54.06/ha being only 18% of expenditure in earthen channels. Poor farming as well as water manage­ment practices contributed to poor levels of irrigation per­formance. Farmers' cooperatives were found either not to be functioning or operating only very poorly, and many insti­tutional problems existed. Pipe systems are more economical than channel systems when the initial cost is affordable. There is however consid­erable potential to increase the net returns from buried pipe schemes through more efficient utilisation."

Although the quality of groundwater in the country is generally good and usable for most domestic, municipal and industrial purposes, recent evidence has, however, shown that human activities have caused contamination of aquifers in some areas. These activities include the indiscriminate disposal of refuse and human wastes around dwellings and the injudicious siting of gardens around well fields. Leachate from these diffuse sources probably, therefore, constitutes the most important source of pol­lution of groundwaters in the rural areas of the country. The concern here is that groundwaters, once contami­nated, are not easily restored as the source of contamina­tion may not be easily traced because of the complexity of flow of groundwaters in the fissures of the Basement Complex Rocks. Insanitary well-head conditions resulting from poor drainage and the scouring of storage containers and drinking utensils with dirt are also some of the secondary causes of contamination of the groundwater supplies. Several measures have been evolved to eliminate the contamination problem and these are discussed in this paper."

The task force was split up with teams working in each of the homelands. The Venda group operated in both urban and rural areas. This paper outlines the work of the northern team that worked in the rural area close to the borders of Zimbabwe and the Kruger National Park. Sixty villages were identified and surveyed over an area of about 3,000 Km2. The majority of the communities had inadequate water supply due to poor management, lack of community involvement and homeland consolidation policies. The crisis of the present drought is related more to the endemic poverty of rural South Africans and poor manage­ment than simply to lack of water. 
A two pronged attack was made on the problem: I) An emergency water supply programme consisting of trucking water, repairing existing broken hand pumps and drilling new wells. 2) A long term programme to train village level facilitators so that the villagers could manage their own affairs. The paper will explain the rationale of working with long and short term aims simultaneously and the importance of educating the local professionals to manage the facilitation programme."

Mustafa",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/31640","","In most developing countries, Government policies on water supply, if any, fail to take cognisance of the role of Private Water Vendors (PWVs). Often, political or social considerations constrain most public water corporations from charging appropriate water rates that will enable them to recover even operating costs. Thus, despite huge government investments over the years in the water sector, Public Water Corporations in Nigeria due mainly to low water tariffs that they charge, experience difficulty in maintaining and operating their systems. This situation has resulted in continued deterioration of treatment plants and distribution networks, leading to inadequate and poor service as enough funds could not be generated to replace broken down parts or expand existing systems. The current world wide economic recession has caused most developing countries particularly to experience, in differing degrees, deteriorating per capita income growth, stagnating if not declining government revenues and seri­ous balance of payments and debt servicing difficulties. These have led to drastic cut backs in investments and slow down in on-going projects. To deal with the problems of broken down plants and expansion of existing services, both Federal and State Governments in Nigeria resorted to external loans to finance water projects. Water tariff is too low in all State Water Agencies (SWAs) in Nigeria when compared with the high production costs of water. Water rate in metered residential areas has been found to vary widely from one state to another. It is as low as NO.44/m3 in Barno and Yobe States, slightly up to N2.6/ m3 in Kwara State, averaging NI.35/m3 for the whole country. In the case of unmetered residential areas, the change varies appreciably from N2.00/month in Edo State to NI52.4/month in Anambra and Enugu States, averaging N32.5/month for the whole country. The production cost of water on the other hand is estimated at N20.00/m3. In a recent study conducted by the author, private water vendors operating in towns and cities in the northern part of the country were found to charge an average of N45/m3, more than 33 time the tariff charged by SWAs for metered residential areas. The paper examines the poor state of water supply in most towns and cities in Nigeria which can be traced to inad­equate funding resulting from inability of SWAs to charge higher tariffs to maintain their services. Private water vendors who on the other hand are not licensed but free to fix their rates, make profits and expand their services to all towns and cities in the country. Other than the exorbitant rates charged by Private Water Vendors (PWVs), and that they sometimes obtain their supplies from unhy­gienic sources, nevertheless, their services go a long way towards supplementing government effort. If the services rendered by the water vendors can be taken into consideration, there will be greater participation by the private sector in water resources development includ­ing their eventual involvement in the manufacturing of water equipment, plants and chemicals."

However in order to meet the current national goal of supplying rural communities with clean, safe, and acceptable domestic water supply, surface water as well as ground water resources need to be exploited. Thus there is the need for estimating run-off yield from small rural catch­ments. This paper has explored the appropriateness of extrapolating available hydrologic data for large catchments to estimate streamflow for small catchments. The Pra river basin in south-western part of Ghana was studied. Measured streamflow data from nine rivers in the basin was used to develop regression relations for estimating water yield for ungauged catchments. Limits for extrapolating existing streamflow measurements on large catchments to obtain streamflows for small drainage basins were given. A recom­mendation was made for initiating a nationwide scheme for gauging runoff from small rural catchments. This scheme will involve extensive data collection and parameter estimation for small rural catchments. The database developed will be vital for rural planning and water resources development."

This is a reflection of very low level of contamination by human activity. However during the 1980's high concen­trations of nitrate had been reported in some parts of the upper regions. It is believed that the changes in agricultural practices could be the source of high nitrate level. One consequence of this is that, high iron concentrations in excess of 0.30 mg/ I, the WHO recommended guideline for drinking water quality, is not uncommon. Some boreholes have also been abandoned, especially along the coast because of high concentrations of chloride and total dis­solved solids. The high chloride concentration is thought to be due to sea water intrusion into the coastal aquifers. Thus monitoring of aquifers in the country should be seriously undertaken so that changes in groundwater quality as a result of agricultural practices, anthropogenic activities and other developments could be quickly ob­served."

The pilot works utilised for the study, situated on the site of an existing Ministry of Works operated treatment plant, comprises a header/flash mixing tank, gravel bed flocculators, plain horizontal flow sedimentation tank and a rapid gravity filter. The system has a nominal flow rate of I m3/hr. Inlet raw water turbidities were maintained at around 400 NTU throughout the six week study. Over 90% removal of turbidity was achieved by effective floe formation and sedimentation. Floe carry over was subsequently removed in the filter producing a final water consistently less than the WHO guideline value of 5 NTU. Results from full scale trials on the existing Ministry of Works operated treatment plant are also presented. Alum, the normal coagulant used, was replaced with M.oleifera seed solution and comparable performance was observed. This is the first time that M.oleifera has been used as a primary coagulant at this scale (flow rate 16 m3/hr)."

Banda Kankhulungo",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/28964","","The current drought experiences of Southern Africa including Malawi has shown that the failure of the existing water supply systems to meet demands when water resources are receding can be reasonably described in terms of the clear and definite monetary expenditures and economic losses related to the emergency actions. Malawi through Ministry of Works' Water Department operates over 53 urban and semi-urban water schemes and 56 rural piped water schemes. It is known that frameworks have previously been presented which can allow Water Depart­ment's designers of the stated range of water systems and the utility management to formulate least cost drought emergency plans, and to systematically examine the trade­off between the expected value of the long-term cost of coping with water deficits and the cost of the long-term water supply/conservation projects. This paper examines the suitability of such framework which has been used once in some places as an analytical tool for deficit planning. The analysis of that scheme in Spring Field, Illinois had indicated that the optional short-term programs for the mitigation of potential shortages of water during droughts consist of a combination of moderate demand and loss reduction measures coupled with intensive utilization of emergency water supply systems. To this it is therefore important to note that the choice of demand reduction measures should involve a certain degree of discrimination among various consumer categories in order to avoid substantial losses to the local economy."

Open well water quality was measured in the dry and rainy season and found acceptable for chlorination. Rural village women were taught to dose their HWJs with a diluted household bleach solution to give an organoleptically acceptable dose of 2.0 mg/L chlo­rine. This dose eliminated fecal coliforms within 30 min­utes and protected stored water for 24 hours. A 22 village double blind randomized intervention trial was carried out over a rainy season. No effect of HWJ chlorination on the incidence of diarrhea was detected. A trend was revealed that for children 6-24 months, villages which chlorinated the HWJs did not suffer a significant decrease in the village mean weight-for-height Z-score as compared to control villages (p =.1170). In children 6-24 months and also 25-60 months, the control group suffered a significant increase in the proportion of malnourished children (p=.0002); where­as the intervention group did not experience a significant increase (p=. I 000). The study concluded that women chlorinating their HWJs may be an appropriate avenue of providing safe drinking and cooking water in rural commu­nities."

Banoeng-Yakubo",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/28653","","A large portion of the Voltaian Basin lies within the drought-prone areas of Ghana. A vast majority of the inhabitants of the basin is rural-based farmers who depend mainly on water from ponds with ephemeral streams and depressions for water. During the dry period these surface supplies are usually exhausted leaving the farmers desperate and highly ex­posed to water-borne diseases. Groundwater development offers the best alternative in this area. However, attempts to improve the groundwater situation have been beset with problems associated with exploration and development methodologies, to the point that certain areas have been excluded from groundwater exploration due to their unfavourable morphological and geological setting. This paper attempts to address this teething problem by combining the use of remote sensing techniques, geology and geophysics. Follow-up field studies have revealed that it is possible to find sustainable groundwater for most of the communities if regional surveys take precedence over local site investi­gations. This would involve higher cost in the short term while the long term results would be cost-effective."

Some ingredients of these agrochemicals which may not be indicated on the product label could be injurious to human health if they enter the food chain. Fertilisers could also lead to the eutrophication of surface water sources which often serve as the only source of drinking water for most rural areas. In Ghana, the cultivation of vegetables, especially toma­toes are done intensively with agrochemicals. A prelimi­nary survey with questionnaires was undertaken to find out about agrochemicals in use in the Akomadan and Agogo tomato growing areas and their mode of applica­tion. The study showed that most farmers do farm along river banks during the dry season and handling, storage, formulation, application and disposal were unsatisfactory. No protective clothing are used and signs of rashes and chemical burns were evident. Improper application seemed to have rendered some pesticides ineffective. The dosage of agrochemicals applied was related to the financial status of the farmer. Farmers perception of certain measure­ments were blurred and in Agogo where extension serv­ices are minimal, farmers are left at the mercy of advice from colleagues who are illiterate or had primary educa­tion. Pollution of water sources looked likely from runoff, seepage and direct disposal of agrochemicals."

Waste provides the poor people a last resort to get employment through continuous struggle to survive with minimal income, bad working conditions and socially inferior status. Enhancing the reuse of solid waste can restore some natural cycle and can contribute to solutions of urban
issues like food production, waste disposal, energy shortages and improvement of environmental quality. Recycling decreases the quantity of waste to be collected and disposed, provide job opportunities to the poor people,conserve finite resources and save environment. The items commonly recycled are paper, glass, plastics, rubber etc. Recycling of rubber receives less priority and attention than other waste materials like paper and metals due to its financial value, margin of profit, final product, marketability, quality and public acceptance.
This paper examines local technologies and legislative measures practised in industrialized and less industrialized
countries and suggests actions for an optimal reuse of waste rubber."

This approach results in cost-effective, affordable and sustainable
drainage schemes. The alternative strategy can be described as one of prevention rather than cure by effecting
controls closer to source rather than the traditional approach which results in the transfer of problems downstream,
compounding the problem, resulting in its cumulation and, the need for large scale centralised control. The alternative strategy is set in context relating to the evolution of current practice and the implications of fragmented institutional responsibilities. Issues relating
to socio-economic factors and appropriate development are discussed and the alternative strategy is shown to
incorporate tenets of a holistic approach. The paper concludes by recommending the adoption of the alternative strategy for the provision of urban drainage infrastructure in developing countries. It suggests
that this paradigm shift should help developing countries to leap frog the developmental stages in their provision
of effective urban drainage infrastructure for their rapidly burgeoning urban centres."

Progress has been made, but it has been painfully
slow. At the beginning of the Decade, communities were expected to manage new water supplies after only a few hours or days training. Nowadays many projects have ‘community management’ components which work with the community to train them to manage their water supply. But even so, there are very few rural water
supplies which, two or three years after the departure of the development agency, are still running. The “soft” components of projects are given insufficient priority. Lessons learnt are insufficiently documented and insufficiently disseminated with the result that mistakes continue to be repeated and millions of aid dollars continue to be wasted. It is time to ask the question: Is community management a viable option. If so, what conditions are necessary for it to work? The aim of this paper is to share the experience of community management of rural water supply in Rwanda."

both problems of unemployment and uncollected waste in low-income areas. Focussing on resource recovery, the research covered the great variety of products made, markets covered and technologies used by smallscale
enterprises in six cities in the South. WASTE Consultants has coordinated this research project, whereas the research itself was carried out by consultants in the following six cities: Manila, Calcutta, Cairo, Nairobi, Bamako and Accra. This paper is based on their findings, on field visits and additional literature and deals specifically with the recovery of organic waste, which was one of the ten materials researched. The paper will focus on small-scale recovery methods of urban organic waste and describes three examples from Bamako, Cairo and Manila. It will also deal with economic feasibility, environmental and health aspects, possible measures for improvement and the role of government authorities."

Habibur Rahman",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/29158","","This paper is a sociocultural case study of Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, on the willingness to pay/use for water supply and sanitation. “Willingness to use” is a relatively new concept which can be defined as the maximum amount of desire one can willingly express for a certain commodity or service. Many technical, institutional, financial and legal factors determine the willingness
to use. Affordability combined with willingness to use leads to willingness to pay. The low “willingness to
pay/use” is one of the reasons behind the unproportional success rate of much of the national and international
efforts undertaken for safe water supply and sanitation. However safe water supply and sanitation is an urgent
need in Bangladesh where the number of water borne diseases cases per 100,000 persons is 51,000, much higher
than other developing countries (WHO, 1992). One of the causes behind this alarming situation is low willingness
to pay/use. Along with a brief description of the present situation in Dhaka city, efforts are taken to identify the problems behind the low willingness to pay/use for water supply and sanitation in light of the sociocultural aspects. This may provide useful information for other developing countries. Some improvement strategies are also proposed."

pathway through junkshops and recyclers is more beneficial for the common good of the public, the government and the environment than the usual waste collection and disposal system currently being managed by the government through dump trucks and landfills. There are about 1000 junk dealers and about 300 recyclers in Metro Manila. This paper has three major topics, namely, 1) previous
government projects dealing with junk shops and pushcart collectors; 2) efforts of NGOs and individuals in supporting

the environmental quality. Women in India, spend a major part of their time in indoor conditions. Cooking in the kitchen, washing clothes, cleaning the house and its surroundings are the important duties which the women perform. Women are exposed to environmental pollution while performing these duties. This is the environment to which women are exposed in particular, however, the general environmental quality affects them equally. Women are victims of environmental pollution. Women, forming 50 per cent of the population can be a very important human resource to combat environmental pollution. Role of women in increasing the awareness of the
requirement of environmental protection is important. Individual and mass movements of women organisations in India have paid rich dividends. Legal battles fought by women in India to protect the environment are worth noting. The present paper covers the role of women in environmental
protection. Legal battles fought by women and achievements made by women organisations in India are also incorporated in the paper."

in December 1991. The object of the mission was to identify and formulate
a series of development orientated project proposals in order to improve the levels of living and earnings of both the Rwandese refugees and the nationals of the host country, aiming at better integration of the refugees in
the host areas. (Ref 1) The emphasis was to be on sustainability and minimal hard currency input. In total 15 projects were identified ranging from potable
water supply to AIDS orphans assistance. The area included the whole of the Kagera region. The paper will outline guidance for project identification
based on this mission. The project identification stage of sustainable development is very important, expectations should not be raised, but the local community should be encouraged and motivated. Also existing work should be networked, to strengthen structures and avoid duplication."

in Uganda WaterAid, has been providing a variety of water systems to rural communities for over 8 years. More recently there has been a greater emphasis on integrating sanitation activities with water projects.
WaterAid has always been committed to community participation but has learnt that for true sustainability,
participation means more than just contributing local materials and labour for constructing a water supply. There has been a lot of talk about how “empowerment” of communities is needed to achieve any real sustainability.
In practical terms this means that communities must feel that they own the water system and are therefore responsible for the operation and maintenance (O&M). Furthermore,
they need to be involved in selecting and promoting improvements in sanitation and hygiene practices,
not just be told (read “educated”) what to do. This is easier said than done. Communities need external assistance
but donors have to be careful in their approach to communities to make sure their participation in the project leads to sustainable systems. This paper provides the experiences of Programme Support Unit (PSU) which was set up to help develop an approach which enhances the way communities participate in water supply and sanitation initiatives."

Baccini",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/29333","","In developing countries problems concerning water quality have agravated during the last decade. While in
industrialized countries the traditional and modern types of water pollution (e.g. domestic, industrial, nutrients)
occured in over a 100- year period, in developing countries however they have occured within one generation [WHO, 1989]. Short time technical measures have important immediate effects, but for achieving sustainability it is critical to develop tools for long term planning which allow a better understanding of how different strategies affect outcomes
and how strategies are sensitive to different levels and types of financing [Bower, 1989]. In industrialized countries the method of Material Flux
Analysis (MFA), has been shown to be a suitable instrument for early recognition of environmental problems and evaluation of environmental measures [Baccini and
Brunner, 1991]. It has been shown that it is possible to combine data from market research on one hand with data from urban waste management on the other hand to
observe the metabolic dynamics of a region [Baccini et al. 1993]. However, this method has not been applied yet in
Developing Countries due to the low data availability and the poor data quality.
The aim of this paper is to show how the method of MFA was applied to a region in a Developing Country with regard to water resource management."

Shirima",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/30312","","One of the most important needs of any community development is a safe and adequate supply of potable water. Unfortunately, there is still a shortage of clean water supply in rural regions of many developing countries like, for example, in Tanzania. A large proportion of the rural population in such countries rely on the availability
of man-made wells, natural springs and rivers, and recently on limited piped water supply schemes. The majority of such sources are not at economical distances from the dwellings. The effectiveness of piped water supply depends on the availability of water storage tanks. Reinforced blockwork
tanks are used as water distribution and storage facilities in some rural areas in Tanzania. They consist of reinforced
concrete roof and floor slabs while the walls are made of reinforced blockwork. The blockwork is made of concrete blocks that contain grooves into which reinforcing bars are laid and embedded in cement mortar. This paper will discuss matters related to design and
construction of such tanks. Since severe cracking and leakage were observed physically to be the major problems,
the authors intend to present, in view of research results, ways by which the tanks can be designed to minimise crack widths and water losses through them."

They are therefore making demands
through self assessment of real needs combining possible technical options, choice, service levels and price that is
best to them. The Community Water Project (COWAP) is a CIDA/Ghana six year Project, which is to assist the Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC) to carry out its Rural Water Supply Programme in the Upper Regions, by adapting to the structures and approaches of the Government Strategic Investment Programme (SIP). The SIP calls for individual communities, using the “demanddriven”
approach, to plan, own and manage their water and sanitation facilities, with the private sector providing goods and services and the Government facilitating the process. The main objective of the COWAP, however is to transfer the ownership and management of some 2700
centrally-maintained handpumps to village level operation and maintenance (VLOM) system. This involves the redevelopment of the boreholes and the replacement of
all the VLOM handpumps (AFRIDEV and NIRA). A project such as the Community Water Project seems to be complex in nature, considering the fact that collective management of handpumps is a new experience for communities. It has been found that village level organizational difficulties normally arise through the problems of cash management, illiteracy, the relative autonomy of households and gender divisions. The Community Water Project since its inception in 1993 has been concerned with working out strategies that will enable communities appreciate
the concept of community ownership, given the fact that the users have been living with the idea that the systems are government-owned for the past 20 years with their inputs only limited to payment of tariffs. This paper therefore compares the Strategic Investment Programme (SIP) with the Community Water Project (COWAP) strategies and outlines some of the steps and approaches which have been taken by COWAP to address the issues in order to ensure sustainability of the
systems."
"WEDC 22nd International Conference","9588692","Natural fabrics in slow sand filtration","Paul Luxton, Nigel Graham",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/30201","","Previous research at Imperial College, London, UK has shown that slow sand filters protected by layers of non-woven synthetic fabrics, namely polypropylene have increased run times in between periods of shut down and regular maintenance, compared to un-protected slow sand filters by up to a factor of 8. This is achieved by the application of fabric layers on the surface of the sand bed. Through careful selection of fabrics, the filtration processes can be concentrated in the fabric layers, hence preventing solids penetration through to the sand, resulting in a reduction in the rate of head loss development. So, as well as extended run times, fabric protected sand filtration can also eliminate the need for sand removal and cleaning. This paper is concerned with replicating these earlier findings through the use of natural fabrics, to a) open up new markets for natural tropical fibres and, b) make available the advantages of protected slow sand filtration to developing countries, utilising local materials and/or minimising the use of foreign exchange. The research has been solely a feasibility study to determine whether natural fibres are suitable materials
for the protection of slow sand filters. Other factors, although important, are not considered at this stage."

Effective O&M results in improved health, socioeconomic and financial benefits. Nevertheless, it is pertinent to note that previously, O&M of water supply systems in rural communities in many developing countries including Ghana has
been neglected. According to the WHO estimates, between 30 per cent - 50 per cent of existing water supply systems are not operational some three to five years after installation (McCommon et. al., 1990). This defeats the objective of water projects to improve the health conditions and well-being of beneficiary communities. The issue of operation and maintenance involves various actors including women. As the main beneficiaries of improved water supply, women offer the best incentive for the success of community management of facilities, hence the need to involve them in sector activities in this
direction. It has been established through experience that women make excellent site managers and are very good
and conscientious in technical maintenance especially in handpump projects as female mechanics (IRC, 1995).
This paper seeks to discuss the current roles women are playing in the area of operation and management of rural
water supply facilities, itemizes some of the factors that account for their limited involvement in key management
activities, and finally, offers suggestions for increased involvement."

Unfortunately handpump programmes have often not shown themselves to be sustainable. This failure has often
resulted because reliance has been placed on costly centralised maintenance systems which have not been affordable. However as Fonseka and Baumann (1994) report from experience in west Africa, even where community management of maintenance is practised, often 3-5 years after a project ends only 60-70 per cent of handpumps
are operational, usually because preventive maintenance has not being carried out.
From their study in Ghana the same authors conclude that the most determining factor for the cost of maintaining handpumps is not the organisational structure (i.e.
whether it is centralised or community based) but is the number of pumps covered by the maintenance system. When a country uses a wide variety of handpumps the
number of pumps of any one type is relatively small. In such countries, standardisation on the use of just one or
two types of handpumps is a necessary step to increase the number of pumps of a particular type to a level at which a sustainable maintenance structure is possible. In this paper I will consider various aspects relating to the standardisation of handpumps."

in many cities for a number of years, but increasing pressure of population in cities and modern ways of living have increased the demand for water. Water is no longer a freely available renewable resource. It is now a scarce resource in the urban areas of the country and will become dearer in future. Local authorities are, according to the acts under which they are set up, supposed to supply water in most urban areas, although there are
different institutional arrangements in many cities. The task of providing water is made tougher by the existing
practices such as low tariff and infrequent revision, political
interference, low efficiency etc. These factors coupled with the exhaustion of accessible sources of water have added to the woes of city dwellers. Cities today are investing huge amounts of money in developing new sources and conveying water to urban areas. The present paper briefly discusses the water supply situation in the urban areas of the country and recommends
a new financing anal institutional option for financing new projects. The paper argues that with such new arrangements the supply situation would improve and local governments could confer the entire population to achieve the goal of reaching the unreached by the turn of the century."

Prime constraints on sustainable development are the low and erratic rainfall and the limited availability of ground and surface water resources. Rainfed crop production provides the main source of staple foodstuffs. However, increasing population densities, all too frequent droughts and declining productivity of existing croplands have led to cultivation of more marginal terrain which is better suited to other, less intensive forms of land use. In areas where sufficient water resources are available, large irrigation schemes have been constructed. However, such schemes have been beset by a wide range of technical, institutional and social problems. It has also been difficult to reconcile such
schemes with traditional farming practices. In contrast, experience in the region has shown that informal or garden irrigation can be economically viable and appropriate to households, especially for women farmers, for
whom it is already a traditional component of the farming system. In 1988, a programme of research was started in southern Zimbabwe, the main objectives of which were to study the feasibility of using shallow crystalline basement aquifers as a source of water for small-scale irrigation and to compare and develop methods of low-cost, high efficiency irrigation which would be suitable for use
on small irrigated gardens. This paper gives a brief description of some elements of this programme. More information can be found in Lovell et al (1996) and Murata et al (1995)."

The estimates show that the system is
sustainable only if user financing is introduced. Since the rate affects the poorer and weaker sections adversely, Faulhaberian cross-subsidy is suggested and estimated
from users above poverty line for all the states in India. Several other reasons are suggested in justifying such a policy change. The most important amongst them are: (a)
efficiency; (b) equity; and (c) sustainability. The increase in efficiency, it is argued, comes from both sides of supply
and demand. The equity argument is centered around the increased availability of services with better quality at a subsidised rate for users belonging to the group exempted from cost recovery. Sustainability is attributed to the better maintenance of the system and timely replacement of old systems using the resource generated from user charges. International evidence on the validity of these hypotheses is very weak at least for health, education, water supply and sanitation. The case of rural water supply is
even weaker mainly due to the dearth of research effort, theoretical as well as empirical, on these aspects. This paper looks at sustainable development and the relevance

This paper shows some examples of how local village women in Okhaldhunga District in eastern Nepal were
successful in bringing drinking water to their villages and in carrying out other development activities by forming
their own local non-government organizations (NGOs). This was accomplished despite the traditionally low status and homebound situation of women in Nepali culture. The hindering attitudes were overcome by a spirit of

A comprehensive research programme has been carried out in the 60’s and 70’s at the
National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in Nagpur, India, to develop appropriate methods
for defluoridation of drinking water. As an important outcome of this programme it was concluded that the Nalgonda Technique is preferable at all levels because of
the low price and ease of handling (Bulusu et al 1979). The Nalgonda Technique has been introduced in Indian villages
and studied at pilot scale in e.g. Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania (Gitonga 1984, Lagaude et al. 1988, Gumbo 1987). This paper describes a modified design and an

Also there are many solitary houses far away from any village. Providing water to all these scattered houses by means of the
conventional techniques is very expensive due to the total length of pipe required. Further more, it also puts a high workload on the households because of the extensive labour inputs required for trench digging. Fortunately, in many cases small springs can be found relatively near to these houses. Developing these small springs and tapping the water for distribution is the subject of this paper. In fact, the spring protection technique discussed here can also be used for much bigger springs supplying water to Gravity Flow Water Supply Systems."

One of such projects is the Volta Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (VRWSS) Project, which is a joint effort between the Ghana Government and DANIDA.
The Project is being implemented in the Volta Region of Ghana which has a population of about 1.7 million (about
ten per cent of the population of Ghana). About 80 per cent of the people of the Region live in rural communities with population less than 5000, which is the target number for the VRWSS Project. The Volta Region is divided into twelve administrative districts and the Project is being implemented in all twelve over a period of ten years (1992 - 2002). The Project aims at reaching the unreached communities in the Project area with potable water and improved sanitation facilities. The Project will also build the capacity of the communities to manage these facilities on their own to secure sustainability."

Over the water decade (and
thereafter), integrated water resource management has featured prominently at a number of global meetings, conferences and symposia (e.g. the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit) resulting in the international acceptance and recognition of a number of primary WRM principles
and approaches for the potable water supply and sanitation sector. These principles can now form the basis for
sound integrated WRM when water and sanitation projects are developed.
Findings from a participative assessment - carried out on two Mvula Trust funded projects in the Mpumalanga Province – to evaluate the implementation of these WRM
principles, indicate a very encouraging degree of adherence. However, problems such as the need to carry out need assessments and thence the tailoring of training capacity building programmes to suit the local project. The WRM principle that “efficient water use is essential and often an important water resource” could never be truer as this part of the country is very water scarce. The paper also makes a suggestion that whilst delivery is the primary objective, planners and implementing agents need to conciously incorporate WRM planning considerations when implementing new projects."

Ngwabi",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/30158","","Water supply schemes for rural and urban fringe (periurban) communities generally cost more per capita than for urban communities in formal township layouts. The main reason for the increased cost is the lower population density in rural and urban fringe communities. Cost per
capita is often the key criteria used to determine the feasibility of schemes.
Consequently engineers are continuously under pressure to reduce the capital costs of water supply schemes to these communities by using more appropriate design standards. There are many established design standards that can be
adjusted to suit the specific requirements of rural and urban fringe water supply schemes to effect a reduction in the capital costs of these schemes. Most will reduce the capacity of the scheme and can result in operation and maintenance problems. These problems nearly always result in increased operation and maintenance costs. This paper discusses the methods of reducing the capital costs in the design of rural water supply schemes, the implications of adjusting these design parameters and identifies design parameters that have a net positive effect on a scheme. It should be noted that community participation in agreeing to the standards discussed in this paper is essential to the success of the project. The communities must be informed why certain standards are adopted and how these will impact on them."

Later conjunctive water use, which is defined as the coordinated combined creative exploitation of groundwater and surface water, in order to minimize the dislocation produced by nature’s inconsistent rainfall patterns, (Lehr et. al., 1985) was tried but failed, due to lack of detailed planning and the misapplication of water management techniques.

state’s capacity to offer basic services to the various populations living all over the globe. Thus, an increasing majority of the world’s economic sectors recognizes the
superiority of private initiative and market pressures over collective initiative and centralized planning. More and more analysts are recognizing the fact that well-being will be the result, of personal effort, of the private sector, of competition between enterprises and of a less prominent
role of the state. In this context, rural areas of very least advanced countries were neglected because the state was overly concerned with urban constituents belonging to a particular social sector; efforts undertaken in rural areas were sporadic at best. This kind of situation could be perpetuated in less advanced countries like in some parts of Africa, or some Asia or in a country such as Haïti. The direct consequence of this situation is the persistent economic exclusion of the rural areas. Conversely, the current
neo-liberal movement opens the opportunity to re-think the non-urban areas located in severely underdeveloped countries. A new management concept that would stop or
reverse the tendency to economically restrict these sectors is needed. One could naturally question how sound the
possibility of cooperative management would be if applied to offer crucial basic services such as water and essential sanitation; these services have traditionally been provided
by the state. This study proposes to explore the feasibility it would be to create such public service enterprises."

No area is immune, and includes the province of KwaZulu-Natal which receives about twice as much rainfall as the other provinces in South Africa, and has about
40 per cent of the country’s rainfall runoff. A prolonged period of below average rainfall in the late 1980’s had a cumulative effect on the country’s water
resources and when the seasonal rainfall for 1992-93 was the second consecutive year of rainfall below 75 per cent
(Calow et al, 1996), the impact was devastating. Most of the areas worst affected had large rural populations. This drought exacerbated an already existing problem of inadequate water supplies. The response to this crisis was for a group of government and non-government organisations to jointly launch a drought relief programme in all affected areas. This programme was terminated in December 1993 with the onset of good rains at the start of the 1993-94 wet season. In retrospect, it was terminated prematurely as the rains
ended early and many areas remained in a water-stressed situation. A second drought relief programme, organised
and executed primarily by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF), was initiated in the northern part of the country in September 1994 and with continuing poor rainfall at the start of the 1994-95 wet season, in KwaZulu-Natal in January 1995. The procedures used in conducting the drought relief exercise differed slightly throughout the country according to circumstance. This paper discusses the methodology applied to the province of KwaZulu-Natal, particularly to the Zululand region in the north."

Bangladesh crawls at a rate far below expectation. The decade old countrywide rural sanitation programme is structured on a network of nearly 1000 sanitation centres. The mandate of these centres is to provide hardware and software services to the people under their respective
jurisdiction. Programme monitoring reveals that the performance of these centres is declining and gradual increase in stockpiling of latrine components is an emerging problem. The primary reason is being the saturation of demand within the natural command area of a centre. In this
context, promotion of sanitation through mobile centres is being conceptualized recently. These proposed mobile centres are expected to render similar services to their respective command area, while the nature of their establishment set up will allow their relocation to another place
identified on a demand driven basis. This continued relocation process will optimize resource investment and will accelerate sanitation coverage particularly in remote areas. A recent evaluation on a few pilot mobile centres, indicates encouraging response and viability of the concept.
The paper aims at highlighting the evaluation findings and drawing conclusions relating to sanitation promotion through mobile centres."

Asthana",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/29032","","Studies of pipe-water demand in developing countries have traditionally analysed household connection decisions to the pipe water system. These studies have yielded useful insights on the value of water and savings in time (e.g., Altaf et al., 1992; Asthana, 1995, 1996, 1997; Singh et al., 1993). Empirical observations, in some places, however, reveal that often households augment piped water supply with alternate sources. Households invest in coping strategies in the form of alternative supplies and storage facilities. Because these strategies have important implications, there is a need to
develop an understanding of households’ water demand that goes beyond connection decisions. On the basis of theoretical advances made by BenAkiva, and Lerman, (1985) and their application by Madanat, and Humplick (1993), this paper presents a
model system of household water supply choices. The model accounts for the possibility that the households may use different supply systems for different uses of water. Moreover, the relation between the households’ choice of water supply and their connection decisions is
explicitly modelled."

Little has been
done towards investigating ground water pollution patterns arising from core existing pit latrines and wells. Generally latrines are sited within the homestead. Sites for wells are as determined by groundwater availability.
Most rural sanitary facilities deposit wastewater into the ground from which water is obtained for domestic purposes. On-site wastewater disposal facilities must be monitored for the likelihood to pollute water supply sources to guarantee investments in rural water and sanitation supplies. In rural areas where the population continues to grow the land available for homestead use decreases in proportion. Land reform programs tend to
increase homestead densities in zoned residential areas and reduce distances between pit latrine and family wells
thereby increasing the possibility of groundwater effluent pollution. It is therefore possible that effluent from
latrines may pollute adjacent wells within the homestead. We are investigating the extent and seasonal variation of pit latrine effluent constituents in groundwater. This
report presents preliminary findings from monitoring sites in Epworth."

camps. Their condition on arrival can vary dramatically, depending on their state before they left home and the
distance travelled. Their initial experiences of the camp’s life are confusing and bewildering. At the same time they are exposed to lots of problems such as malnutrition, illness, inadequate shelters, poor water supply, health care and frequently, non existent sanitation facilities. The problem of poor sanitation in refugee camps starts at the beginning. This is mainly due to the fact that it is not given as high a priority as other emergency interventions such as health care, food and water supply. This is despite
the fact that many of the diseases common amongst refugees are caused by inadequate sanitary facilities such as
excrete disposal, solid waste management, domestic wastewater management, vectors and pest control and a poor understanding of hygiene practices. However, there are other causes of poor sanitation, lack of expertise and trained people, lack of time, and a low level of interest in the
subject by camp managers and refugees. The result is that a proper sanitation assessment does not take place leading
to poor choice of technology. Furthermore, poor communication
between agencies and the affected population, fails to establish a strategy that will encourage the community to participate in environmental sanitation activities. Providing sanitation facilities alone does not, in itself, guarantee health improvements, they must also be used effectively. This paper will discusses these problems, their causes, and

UFW is a fraction of water produced but not billed for, and is a measure of the
efficiency of the water utility. UFW is made up of physical system losses and commercial losses. The high figures of UFW for the water utilities translate
into high production costs with low sales. To compound the problem, many African water utilities do not even
collect all the money billed for, leading to the ever-increasing arrears. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, these water utilities are too cash-trapped to maintain the existing infrastructure, let alone improve service levels."

The first batch of 300 defluoridators are in operation for more than three years. These defluoridators have advantages such as simple in design, easy operation by villagers, absence of any maintenance, availability of the freshly burnt bricks in the locality and frequency of changing bricks in an average of four months for a fluoride content of well of 2.5mg/l.
The performance and efficiency of these defluoridators are very good in the first two years thereafter lack of interest was shown if regular visits are not made to beneficiaries. Organisational structure is necessary to follow monitoring and evaluation of these units for a minimum period of five years to get the best from this locally developed technology."

A high proportion of new development is provided without services in the first instance and the subsequent provision of services puts great strains formal mechanisms for the provision of shelter and services. Sanitation is no exception in this regard. Even where services are provided, their working life is often reduced by poor operation and maintenance, due in part to
lack of resources. The consequences for urban sanitation coverage are serious. World Bank figures suggest that in 1990, at the end of the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade, 453 million urban people,
or 33 per cent of the urban population in developing countries had no sanitation services (Wright 1997). This overall figure masks considerable differences between different cities and areas and there is no doubt that coverage rates are much lower for the urban poor. For example, surveys in low income ‘bastis’ in Howrah, Calcutta revealed
up to 200 people sharing a single WC."

It offers access to safe water for approximately 40-80 per cent of the water supply provided to the urban population, and it is the largest fresh water source in the country. Despite the high initial cost, groundwater is increasingly becoming an important source of drinking water supply in Ethiopia. The drought in 1984/85 in Ethiopia inflicted heavy losses both in human and livestock population. In response to this drought, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and Lay Voluntary International Association (LVIA) jointly drilled and equipped a total of 50 wells between 1986 and 1997 in the rift valley areas. This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the hydrology, water quality and the usefulness of these wells."

Chemical precipitation, reverse osmosis and other methods become inefficient when contaminants are present in trace concentrations. The
process of adsorption is one of the few alternatives available for such situations (Huang and Morehart, 1991). A
number of adsorbent materials have been studied for their capacity to remove heavy metals, including activated carbon, activated alumina, ion exchange resins, crushed coals etc. Some of these materials, such as ion exchange resins are totally effective but expensive and others, such as coal and straw, are inexpensive but ineffective. Activated carbon is very effective in removing heavy metals, but is readily soluble under extreme pH conditions (Huang and
Blankenship, 1989). Peat moss has been found as very effective in adsorbing heavy metals (Ho, 1995). In the present study Slow Sand Filters (SSFs) are tried to remove heavy metals and found very effective (Muhammad et al, 1997). Experimental results on the influences of process variables in removing heavy metals by SSFs demonstrated that adsorption was one of the mechanisms of the removal of heavy metals (Muhammad et al, 1997). To confirm this prediction/hypothesis, batch adsorption tests were carried out. This paper deals with the results of the batch adsorption
tests to establish adsorption isotherms and adsorption capacity of the sand for the selected heavy metals."

This argument is supported by an increasing demand for water supplies to satisfy the requirements of strategic reclamation plans in Egypt. The new situation necessitates promoting water availability within the Egyptian Nile system by groping towards optimum cropping patterns. Rice is therefore expected to compete for an increasingly scarce water supply according to free market criteria. In view of the above, the current paper brings the issue of growing rice in the Nile Delta into focus. This is carried out through probing various factors that influence rice cultivation with respect to anticipated water scarcity and perceived economic ramifications. The objective is to work out a rice production limit that would ensure sound land resource use, sustain the local population, and optimise economic returns."

The availability of low cost electricity together with a culture that has historically considered water as being free to all, has led to huge demands for groundwater. From the information available it is clear however, that groundwater in the Quetta valley is being mined, with groundwater levels falling at 1m a year, which is a cause for concern that demands immediate attention.

The problems that are experienced with this approach is that it frequently does not cater to the aspirations of the sections of the population that desire a more convenient
level of service and can set the entry level of sanitation too high so that the section of the population most at risk is unable too attain it. This has resulted in low levels of coverage (30% in Zimbabwe and Lesotho 50% after 20
years). It is argued that improvements in sanitation can only be achieved by changing people’s behaviour. Behaviour change is only achieved if people are given a series of small attainable goals which lead to constant improvement. South Africa has just commenced with its sanitation programme. By giving people a choice of technologies and utilising Participatory Health and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) methodology it is hoped that South Africa will be able to achieve the above goals. The paper will set out the framework which is being put in place to achieve this and suggest ways in which an incremental approach to

The purpose of this following paper is therefore in light of the WEDC conference topic entitled ‘Sanitation (Solid Waste Management) and Water for all’ which should raise the question how do we provide effective and efficient solid waste management services to ‘all’? This paper highlights one of the key actors in assisting to try to provide SWM
services to ‘all’ namely Non-Government and CommunityBased Organisations specifically within the context of India."

following a study entitled “The Urban Poor in Bangladesh” by Centre for Urban Studies, University of Dhaka in 1979. Following this, the government in four
major cities undertook a project named Urban Community Development Project (1982-85) with UNICEF assistance. This concept of community based activities for the urban poor included organising the communities in groups, provision of income generation loans for women,
installation of tubewells and sanitary latrines, and construction of drains. This was further expanded and developed in Slum Improvement Project (SIP) implemented during 1989-1996. Initially Ministry of Social Welfare and later LGED from 1987 became the implementing
agency for the SIP covering 85 slum settlements in 4 city corporations and 16 district towns. The project was a success as it provided basic physical
infrastructure to the most neglected part of the city and made provision of economic activities by organising and
training the urban dwellers especially women. Encouraged by the sustainability of its components, LGED now included this concept of slum activities in all of its urban projects covering 419 slums and over 65,000 families in 40 municipalities and 4 city corporations.
The authors being intimately involved in the urban sector projects try to describe the activities concerning
the slum women for their economic and social emancipation."

Samples of water from stream, spring and fluoridated water was used to see effect of storage and appropriate home made filters in the reduction of fecal coliform, turbidity colour, and fluoride. After the samples were initially tested for these parameters, they have been stored for one, two and three days in clay pots, plastic (jerrycan) and metal bucket. The result showed a reduction of fecal coliforms by 100 per cent, 89.6 per cent and 74.6 per cent in metal bucket, plastic (jerrican) and clay pot vessels after
three days of storage, respectively. In addition considerable reduction of turbidity and colour was also achieved. On the other hand local clay pots showed effect in reducing
fluoride concentration after storage. Filtration of fluoridated water sample through crushed brick and local clay
pot have shown an average reduction of fluoride concentration by 57.2 and 93.8 percent, respectively. This study has revealed that storage of raw water and using clay filters can remove biological, physical and chemical
contaminants up to recommended values by WHO. It is believed that with further perfection communities who

Efforts to supply potable water to rapidly urbanising centres commonly target groundwater on account of its perceived potability that necessarily avoids the high treatment costs
which are associated with surface-water sources. Groundwater is supplied through spring discharges, manually pumped wells (<0.2L/s), and more intensively pumped,
production boreholes (>0.2L/s). Despite the costs of constructing groundwater-fed waterworks, the impact and viability of abstraction are unknown and typically subject to cursory assessments prior to development. Furthermore, the susceptibility of groundwater-fed water supplies to contamination in the urban environment, where the subsurface acts not only as a supply of water but also a
repository for sewage and industrial effluent, has not been rigorously studied. This paper highlights key uncertainties regarding weathered aquifer systems in sub-Saharan Africa
such as hydraulic conductivity, aquifer storage, recharge, contaminant attenuation and drawdown due to pumping
which affect the development of groundwater in the urban environment. Recommendations for research to improve
understanding of urban groundwater development in this setting are provided."

options have been discarded due to complexities or cost, or where subsidies are applied for specific promotion of
DRWH. In this paper we will consider the use of domestic roofwater harvesting in humid tropical areas of the world.
It is demonstrated that the uptake of this technology in areas with favourable climatic conditions, and where users
are willing to modify their behaviour, can bring sufficient quantities of clean water to large numbers of people for a
large part of the year, without the usual prohibitive initial costs. Firstly, we will consider the climatic implications on DRWH and see what effect preferential rainfall patterns can have on the cost of the DRWH system, especially the cost of water storage. Secondly, we will consider user patterns and show how suitable user behaviour (consumption pattern) can again improve the desirability of a DRWH
system. Finally we will look at the work being done at Warwick University (and by other members of the Roofwater Harvesting Research Group) on reducing costs of roofwater collection systems and improving the quality of stored rainwater for use in high rainfall areas."

Within the past two years, 200 Community Health Clubs have been established in 5 Districts of Zimbabwe, with around 10,000 members. They are proving that not only
do they stimulate a strong demand for improved sanitation but that they actually promote positive behavioural changes leading to greatly improved levels of hygiene in the home. This paper analyses Community Health Club from a
social perspective, demonstrating how and why they are formed. It also explores the reasons for the popularity of the clubs and looks at the psychology behind the success of this new methodology."

more possible and necessary to design water projects not in terms of specific technologies or prearranged management

In this sense, we see water programs as being increasingly shaped by social development methods and objectives. Particularly prominent are issues related to the empowerment of the poor and marginalized. Since 1992, CARE International has been working in peri-urban settlements in Zambia, in a variety of mutually-reinforcing project interventions, such as infrastructure improvements and micro-finance. This paper explores one particular experience, the establishment of a community-managed

Handover of maintenance from the NGO to local government is often difficult and it is at this point that much of the gains of the agency can be undone. Agencies use a variety of participatory approaches, village level maintenance structures, standardised pumps to fit government recommendations, organisation of spares supply and training of local government teams. This paper presents the work of an interagency project funded by the British Government (DFID) which compares and contrasts recent variations on these approaches. The project is undertaking a thematic comparison of three case studies in Africa. This is for the practical objective of identifying common elements of a successful exit strategy for resettlement programmes that have introduced new water supplies."

• serving the 11 million rural people (65 per cent) without adequate access to water; and • implementing water supply projects in a sustainable way. The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) has responded to this challenge by proposing to supply a ‘basic level of service’ 1 to all South Africans within the next ten years. However, there is serious doubt as to whether this aim will be realised and as to the sustainability of the existing and proposed projects. DWAF policy is to subsidise the capital cost of a communal
standpipe supply while communities are expected to pay for the running costs. If recurrent costs are to be financed
solely through user charges, this paper argues that supply needs to respond to effective demand. Effective demand for
water means the quantity of water that people demand and are prepared to pay for at a particular price level. This can also termed ‘willingness to pay’ (WTP) and varies for different levels of service e.g. WTP for a communal standpipe may be different to a yard connection. WTP will vary within communities and in order to respond to this varied demand, a mixed level of service needs to be supplied. This paper investigates methods by which demand can be assessed and considers, using a case study, the technical and financial implications of designing to meet demand."

Rather than starting immediately with the implementation of a water and sanitation programme, health education is used as the first point of entry into the project area. By the end of six months of health promotion, the move to improve home hygiene comes naturally to Health Club Members, who readily contribute towards upgrading their own sanitation. In Matebeleland North Province of Zimbabwe, the technical problems of constructing latrines in collapsing Kalahari sands have made latrines expensive to construct and consequently sanitation coverage is often below 10%. To solve this problem, a technology has been devised that enables women to make interlocking bricks and line their
own pits. Whilst the main cost is below ground, the superstructure is constructed cheaply with local materials, resulting in culturally appropriate and therefore sustainable
structures. Zimbabwe A.H.E.A.D is promoting upgradeable sanitation

Since schools are important learning places, the promotion of personal hygiene and environmental sanitation

sanitation facilities are as much a basic need as a right for all children. Moreover, good hygiene education will improve the health and attendance of children and is likely to result in a lower drop out rates. School sanitation and hygiene education(SSHE) is therefore the combination of hardware and software components that are necessary to produce a healthy school
environment. The hardware components are the water and sanitation facilities in and around the school compound. The value of new and improved facilities nevertheless have minimal consequences without the support of hygiene education programmes helping schoolchildren make deliberate

VLOM (Village Level Operation and Maintenance) criteria if the pump is to be sustainable. In general terms the
sustainability of a pump depends on (a) ease of use and maintenance, (b) durability (including corrosion resistance) and (c) the cost and availability of spare parts. However, at present there are no clear guidelines which quantify these factors, so there tends to be debate amongst pump designers, manufacturers and users as to how ‘VLOM’
certain pumps are. The two former factors (the ‘technical’ aspects) tend to be less critical for shallow (less than 30 metres) installations. The loads on the pump are low, allowing the use of lightweight and corrosion resistant plastics such as uPVC and HDPE, and mechanisms can be kept simple and relatively inexpensive. In deeper installations, however, the technical challenges are generally greater. As the loads on the pump increase, the use of stronger, heavier, (and more expensive) materials becomes necessary. This in turn often leads to the need for heavy lifting gear (tripods, chain blocks, pulleys etc) for maintenance, as well as more complicated mechanisms in the pump design. Capital costs, and cost of spare parts all increase, adversely affecting sustainability. At present there are several alternative VLOM pumps for shallow installations, however there are very few available for installations deeper than 45 metres. The added difficulty of spare parts distribution and government restrictions on allowable pump types also means that introducing
new pumps on to the market is very difficult. This paper presents a new pump arrangement which addresses most or all of these difficulties."

rotor speed ( Stephenson et al , 1985 ) and using draft tube turbine aerators (Boyle W.C , 1989) In this paper an attempt has been made to improve the
oxygenation capacity of aeration system by supporting bubble aeration to the conventional aerators and laboratory
study has been made on the performance of oxidation ditch with bubble aeration with reference to domestic wastewater treatment."

The current Ugandan policy is one of decentralisation and privatisation of rural water source construction. It was into this environment that the “Low
Cost Drilling Project” (LDCP) was introduced in 1998 to: • develop a new low cost drilling technology (the Pounder Rig) which would be suitable drilling shallow wells in sub-Saharan Africa, • arrange for its availability in Uganda and • set up small-scale drilling operations through local private contractors. In order to develop the equipment and stimulate local uptake of the rig within the existing rural water supply sector, a partnership between Mpigi District Local Government, the Directorate of Water Development’s (DWD) Water and Environmental Sanitation (WES) Programme and Cranfield University was established in July 1999. This paper outlines the background to the partnership and discusses the lessons which have been learned regarding
the technical capability of the equipment as well as the opportunities and challenges for its future uptake by the Ugandan private sector."

In the present day practice, aeration finds wide application to improve the physical and
chemical characteristics of water for its domestic, commercial and industrial use. Cascade aerators are the most
widely used aerators in the water treatment practices. Many varieties of cascade aerators are in use. Pilot plant studies are often desirable in connection with an engineering analysis of the applicability of aeration
process to water treatment problems. Results of few pilot plant runs, using relatively simple equipment, may if properly analyzed, provide useful aerator design criteria. The literature on design practice of aerator reveals that systematic studies to rationalize the design of this unit have not been made. At present the design of cascade aerator is carried out purely on empirical basis. The design of cascade
aerator is usually carried out on the basis of 0.015 to 0.045 sq.m of plan area per cum/ hour of flow . It does not speak of any oxygen transfer requirements of water treatment
plant. The paper presents the rational approach for cascade aerator design based on oxygen addition on the basis of actual plant studies conducted at three different water works having 100 MLD, 30MLD & 20 MLD capacity. The present paper highlights the data and the results obtained during the study conducted at Wena water works, Nagpur of 30 MLD capacity."

A study on the effectiveness of using seawater for non-potable purpose and how the consumption of potable water can be reduced was carried out four years ago (Smith, Stear and Parr, 1996). Its conclusion was that dual water supply systems could become an increasingly viable option for large urban areas in coastal zones. Hong Kong is one of those few cities using the dual systems, and the systems have been available since the 1950’s. The objectives of this paper are to describe the implementation of the dual water supply systems in Hong Kong and evaluate the effectiveness of the systems.

billion cases of diarrhoea are reported in the world every
year, with 2.2 million deaths annually, mostly among
children under five. However, it has always been a major
challenge to quantify the extent of impact of water,
sanitation, and hygiene education interventions due to
methodological complexities and confounding variables
(Briscoe, Feachem, and Rahman, 1985; Cairncross, 1990;
Esrey et al., 1991; Gorter and Sandiford, 1997). Major
methodological flaws identified included the problems of
(i) comparability of treatment and control groups, (ii)
sample size required, (iii) misclassification bias, and (iv)
recall bias in ascertaining disease status amongst others.
Measurement of the impact of water, sanitation, and
hygiene interventions becomes even more difficult, when
implementing agencies set objectives/targets based on health
impact e.g., reduction of water and sanitation related
diseases. These difficulties stem from lack of resources
both human and financial, operational difficulties, time
limitation, and inability in implementing proposed plans
due to factors falling beyond organisational control. The

The effect of hydrology of the catchment on the required
storage volume depends upon the temporal uniformity, or
lack of it, of the streamflow and the causal rainfall4. For a
given D and R, a reservoir on a catchment

During the period from 1994 –2000, the prevailing view in
the South African water sector was that some form of cost
recovery from the beneficiary communities was necessary
to compensate for the scarcity of external funding. Cost
recovery became to be seen as so central to sustainability
that, in many schemes, it became almost an end in itself.
However pronouncements during the local government
election of 2000 regarding the provision of “free” water
have called into question the appropriateness of cost
recovery.
This paper will step back from a detailed assessment of
specific cost recovery methodologies and focus on the
broad objectives and principles underpinning cost recovery
on rural water schemes. It will ask whether the pursuit of
cost recovery is really worth the cost given the changing

for the present water and sanitation sector. Estimates for
coverage are 30% for urban water and 40% for sanitation.
Rural water coverage is said to be 35% and rural sanitation
coverage 25%. In some cases non-functioning systems are
included.
The central player in the water sector is the National
Directorate for Water (DNA) within the Ministry of Public
Works and Housing. Mozambique has moved from civil
war to peace and democracy. The sector has moved from
non-sustainable emergency water projects to serious efforts
towards sustainable systems. The DNA has changed its role
from project design and implementation to policymaking,
strategic planning, facilitation and regulation. Recent laws
provide a legal base for new concepts that include privatisation
and community participation. New water accords
are being forged with neighbouring countries, setting the
stage for minimising future conflicts.
Major projects have been started such as the privatisation
of 5 cities and a demand-based rural project in Inhambane.
The long- and short-term challenges are to increase coverage
in a sustainable way. The process of change and its
concomitant internal and external resistance play a role in
modifying the actions taken as well as blocking muchneeded
improvements. The first steps have been taken
despite the constraints.
The opinions on the DNA as an institution range from it
being a dynamic organisation, to being a stumbling bureaucratic
state apparatus. The truth probably lies between
these two extremes."

by a waste collection service, disposed of in uncontrolled

contributing to more than 50% of the total waste amount,
threatens the health of residents as the indiscriminate waste
dumps attract rodents and other disease carrying vectors.
Organic waste is also responsible for pollution of soil and
water bodies through leachate, and in the process of uncontrolled
anaerobic degradation it contributes to global warming
by the production of methane. A possible step in
mitigating these detrimental effects is enhancing resourcerecovering
activities of the organic waste fraction. An
obvious treatment and recovery option for organic waste is
composting. However, before strategies can be developed on
how to proceed, it is necessary to understand the existing

has been done. Azo dyes namely, Orange-II (C.I. Acid
Orange 7), Reactive Blue-H􀆁R (C.I. Reactive Blue 13),
Reactive Red-HE7B (CJ.Reactive Red 141) and Reactive
Black-3HN (CI.Reactive Black 8) were selected for the
study. Anaerobic decolourisation experiments were
conducted for a period of more than 50 days with a
hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10 days and at ambient
temperatures. Oxidative decolourisation studies were
conducted with varying peroxide dosage of 1.5 to 50
mM H202 concentrations. Decolourisation efficiencies
achieved during anaerobic process was more than 99%
for all the dyes evaluated. In case of hydrogen peroxide
(SO mM H202 cone.) treated dye solutions,
decolourisation efficiencies observed were 37, 12, 5 and
10% for orange, blue, red and black dye respectively.
Fenton's reagent (Fe(II) + 50 mM H20) achieved 99 %
decolourisation for dyes Orange-II and Reactive BlueH3R.
Therefore it seems that anaerobic process would
be economical for decolourisation of azo dyes m

Sanitation coverage for rural areas is only 41.3 %, which in some cases goes down to 15%. Considering the situation, VERC thought of looking for a more effective approach to address the situation.

safe drinking water at community and family level, there
are many different ways to make safe drinking water
available and affordable for family use in low-cost countries
and emergencies. Chlorination is the most common
practice both for providing safe water at large-scale schemes
for villages or urban settlements by batch treatment and for
families by disinfecting the collected water with tablets.
This way of providing safe water has many advantages
mainly because it makes the water safe also during carrying
it home and handling it at family place. The provision of
safe water relies on the proper dosing of chlorine and the
availability of chlorine in the respective form, such as
powder, tablets, liquid gas, etc. However, chlorination has
also been difficult to introduce due to the changes in water
taste, which has often made the population to go back to
non-treated traditional sources. Usually, an effort is needed
in health education to make a community to accept and to
welcome chlorinated water as a safer drinking water supply.
In conclusion from many water projects, it can be said
that the taste change of the drinking water is an underestimated
obstacle in improving the health of a population by

as a vehicle through which the construction industry
can address its need for innovation and improved business
performance. The failure to capture and transfer project
knowledge, which is usually buried in unread reports and
arcane filing systems, or lost because people move on, leads
to the increased risk of ‘reinventing the wheel’, wasted
activity, and impaired project performance. Knowledge is
therefore considered vital in creating competitive advantage
in the new economy. Much of the growth in many
global firms has been credited to knowledge, as new
technologies and innovations are applied to the market and
workplace. Knowledge management is therefore increasingly
seen as an integral part of an organization’s competitive
strategy as it facilitates continuous improvement through
learning and innovation. This is now increasingly recognised
by most sectors of industry, with many organisations
appointing a Knowledge Manager or Business Improvement
Manager, with responsibility for articulating and
implementing the organisation’s knowledge management
strategy. This paper argues that knowledge management is
equally important in development projects and advocates
the application of knowledge management practices to
these projects. It introduces the key phases in knowledge
management (creation, storage, sharing, modification, etc.)
and explores how these can be implemented in development
projects. The application of knowledge management
to development projects is expected to result in numerous
benefits including the transfer of lessons learned from one
project to another, improved transfer of knowledge between
developed countries and developing countries, and
better management of human resources. This paper starts
with a review of key knowledge management concepts, and
outlines some of the characteristics of development projects.
It then discusses the potential for knowledge management
in development projects and concludes with a summary of
the practical benefits to be gained."

dumped along the streets, behind homes and drainage channels. Therefore the urban dweller is very much in contact with
the waste generated by him. The government has not been able to handle satisfactorily the problem of solid waste. Every
state government in Nigeria has an urban council charged with, among other things, keeping the urban environment free
of solid waste. The Enugu State Environment Protection Agency [ ENSEPA] is charged with this responsibility in Enugu,
Nigeria. We only need to come out of our houses, and the next thing we see is refuse heaps not up to ten metres away from
the house. It is evident from the above discussion that the sanitary condition in Enugu, and in fact most of our urban areas
present a dreadful picture. The main problem could therefore be inadequate arrangements for the collection and disposal of
solid waste. However, in our rural communities, it has been observed that household solid waste does not pose a problem.
This might be due to the fact that the rural communities organise themselves into community action groups, to keep their
environment clean. Public places such as markets, village squares, cemeteries, streams or springs- water areas, as well as
pathways connecting various compounds and villages are kept in good sanitary conditions.There is a kind of togetherness
or neighbourliness going on in the rural communities. This communal living may have encouraged participation in local
activities. Is it possible that we could encourage such communal living within urban neighbourhoods?"

and more sustainable ones are possible. This in turn has affected government’s efforts to increase rural water supply coverage,
which currently stands at 58 percent. In order to significantly improve water supply coverage in the country using
low-cost, simple water-supply technologies, Uganda has initiated a Groundwater Mapping Programme to prepare maps
representing groundwater resources in terms of their quantity and quality and summarizing this information spatially. Six
different types of maps have been prepared all of which are important in guiding proper planning of groundwater development
activities. Groundwater maps are guiding district political and technical officials on the most feasible water supply
technology options to consider in various areas and are also providing them with indications of areas with low water supply
coverage, which require more attention. The districts are now exclusively constructing shallow wells in areas where
they are indicated as feasible as opposed to the past practice of construction deep boreholes everywhere. The people with
the lowest water supply coverage are also using the maps to bargain for their equitable share of government resources.
It is expected that with the availability of groundwater maps there will be a reduction in failure of wells and cost of water
supply systems resulting in increase in water supply coverage and hence more benefit to the people."

the most important challenge facing the rural water sector in Ghana. Up to 30% of drilled wells contain high levels of
manganese, iron, arsenic and fluoride. A third of boreholes containing these substances are abandoned, whiles the rest are
marginally used. This translates to about $ 900 lost of resources on every borehole drilled in the affected regions. Iron and
manganese removal plants developed in the 1990s are ineffective, the major set back being short filter run. Recent research
revealed that activated carbon prepared using charcoal, and iron oxide or manganese oxide coated quartz sand have high
adsorption properties, which aid the removal of iron and manganese. Based on results of this study, the Mwacafe plant was
developed. Available data on performance of Mwacafe indicate that a filter run of between 3 to 12 months is achieved."

of environmental studies, and to inform urban protection policy and management. This paper is focused on modelling in
the GIS to estimate air, water and soil pollution in urban areas. The basic environmental components are complemented
by bio-monitoring, waste management and noise exposure. The models, which use data from long-time monitoring, are
developed using correlation, regression and factor analysis; simulation of dynamic relation and spatio-temporal phenomena.
Integration of a wide range of relatively independent factors enables more complex analysis of environment in
urban areas. GIS, which can integrate a wide range of spatial and temporal data, is used for data management, input and
output of data, visualization and development of programming modules that extend GIS with other statistical analysis and
dynamic modelling. The analysis and models were built in ArcGIS with ArcObjects. In spite of the fact that the models are
calibrated and tested by application in the urban areas of Prague, the structure of the GIS project is applicable on other
similar areas. The fundamental part of the environmental models is focused on modelling of surface-water quality, soil
pollution and their relation to human activities and air pollution. The models use data measured during decades, which
are collected from manually and automatic pollution monitoring networks. The map layers are divided into a few classes
that represent basic maps of urban areas in the scale 1:500, thematic maps, aerial photographs, monitoring networks, and
outputs of environmental models. The spatio-temporal analysis and dynamic environmental models are accessible through

rural people have access to safe water within 150 meters. This scenario, in comparison to many other developing countries
is excellent. The main source of safe water is ground water aquifer. At present, the average number of households per tube
well varies from 2 to 5 (NAMIC, 2003 and 2004). This estimates considers both public and private tubewells. The number
of private tube wells is a few times that of public tube wells indicating that the private sector plays a commendable role.
The presence of arsenic in ground water overshadowed this success. The problem of arsenic contamination has become a
matter of serious concern. It is estimated that about 29 million people are potentially at risk (Ahmed and Ahmed, 2002).
Analysis of data on screening of tube wells shows that there are many villages where almost all water sources are arsenic
contaminated. About 8000 villages have been found where arsenic contamination rate is 80% or more. It is an urgent need
to provide safe water sources to those villages. Dug well, deep hand pump tube well, pond sand filter and rainwater harvesters
are considered as alternative options for providing safe water. Arsenic removal technologies are also considered to
treat arsenic contaminated water. All these alternative options are site specific and have some limitations. These alternative
options cannot be considered absolute solutions. Removal technologies have also some limitations.Under such situation
piped water supply using surface water or safe ground water in rural Bangladesh may be considered as long-term solution.

Over exploitation and mismanagement of natural
resources have resulted in the loss of valuable natural resources of semi-arid regions. Groundwater depletion problems
and growing water crises are common in drought prone area of eastern Gujarat region, in western India. Harvesting and
managing natural resources on sustainable basis is the most commonly advocated solution to this problem. The water
harvesting measures when done in an integrate manner in a series are the best possible programme for restoring the
degradation of natural resources. The present study was aimed at assessing the impact of water harvesting structures in rural
tribal village Rozam of district Dahod of Gujarat State. A prominent NGO namely, N M Sadguru Water and Development
Foundation, Dahod helped village in developing a series of water harvesting structures in May 2002. The aim of programme
was to conserve water resources by the local tribal people. Under this programme series of 8 low cost small check dams
were constructed and one existing percolation tank was renovated on a rivulet in village Rozam of district Dahod. Through
the study an attempt has been made to analyze the impact on ground water levels, agricultural production and people
livelihoods in this village. Total 50 open wells on both sides of the rivulet were selected for observing and recording the
ground water levels and yields in these wells. Ground water level observations indicated that the average water table has
gone up by 2.57m in year 2002 and 2.10m in year 2003 in 50 open wells. The well yield has increased from 0.64 lps to
1.50 lps in year 2002 and 1.72 lps in year 2003 after the programme intervention. Before programme the total area under
different crops was 75.58 acre during Rabi season bur after programme, area under Rabi season has increased by 142.41
acre in year 2003 and by 173.26 acre in year 2004. Area under different crops has increased by 88.42% in year 2003 and
129.24% in year 2004. This is a significant improvement which gave sustainability to the peoples lives. The pre and post
programme intervention situation comparison of data indicates that the programme has resulted in increased productivity,
improved income and better food availability. These structures were found useful in improving the ecosystem & developing
water resources base in the village. The study suggests that the approach of a series of check dam is sustainable and viable
option to rehabilitate depleting ecology among the tribals of eastern Gujarat."

in rural drinking water supply programmes, to seek community based water treatment solutions, attached to handpumps
where such problems existed. This was true for iron removal and defl uoridation. However, over the next few years most of
these treatments systems became inoperative, primarily attributed to a lack of a sense of ownership by user communities,
resulting in an attitude of indifference towards the operation and maintenance of these plants. It is also possible that the
complexities of O&M by user communities, in the rural Indian socio-political context, had not been institutionally understood.
Since 1990s there has been an increasing trend to seek household based water quality treatment solution within rural
drinking water supply programmes in India. This paper summarises the experiences of UNICEF in India in tackling the
problem of high fl uoride content in rural drinking water supply sources, using household-based defl uoridation fi lter using
activated alumina. Since 1991, UNICEF supported the research work for development of the technology by the Department
of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur. This resulted in pilot projects on Domestic Defl uoridation
Units in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan during 1996-2002. Gradually a demand for these fi lters has grown
and the private sector is gradually becoming interested. Perhaps this approach, addressing households specifi cally rather
than the nebulous “community” in general, is ensuring the use of safer water to a greater degree."

Manoharan",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/29196","","Some water supply schemes in Sri Lanka very rapidly become unable to meet the demand imposed on them. This premature
‘saturation’ of the components of the water supply facilities such as intake, transmission main, treatment unit, storage
reservoirs and distribution system are discussed in this paper. The reasons for it are that urbanization and industrial
development are taking place at a higher rate than anticipated. As a general practice water supply schemes in Sri Lanka
are designed for a 20-year life span. However most of the water schemes are saturated within a short duration. That is
the 20-year design demand is reached within 4 to 5 years and the water supply infrastructure is unable to cope with the
demand. This paper describes the background of these water supply schemes and causes for premature saturation. It
also suggests concepts and preventive measures that can be used to overcome this problem, when designing water supply
schemes in the future. The high growth in demand is a critical issue in most of the water supply schemes in Sri Lanka.
Though the growth rate, migration, urbanization and industrial growth were considered, when designing the water supply
schemes, the actual rate of increase in migration, urbanization and industrial growth are usually very much higher than
the predicted levels. This results in them very quickly reaching their design capacity. A detail analysis was carried out
of two of these schemes, to find the reasons for the problem and to propose suitable solutions. It is desirable to design a
water supply scheme to cover all areas not yet likely to be developed but which are fed by the existing schemes. This is not
practiced since the funds available are limited. Hence there is a tendency to limit the distribution area in order to make a
scheme affordable. In the years following completion of the scheme the distribution system is often extended in all directions
due to the pressure exerted on the water supply organization by the local political authority. This, coupled with the
usual migration of people towards the water-served areas, leads to the premature saturation of the water supply facilities.
The following optimal solution is suggested, considering all factors related to this issue. It is proposed that at the design
stage all major demands are considered in consultation with all relevant institutions. The investment on the scheme can

Tumusiime, Cyrus Njiru",2006,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/2117","","Although national and international institutions have put much effort in the field of water supply improvement during the
last few years, coverage figures are still low. Many developing countries are taking initiatives to develop mechanisms
of improving delivery of water supply services. One of the initiatives being employed is delegated management of water
services to the private sector, through management contracts. Uganda started water sector reforms in 1997 and took steps
to increase involvement of the private sector in management of its urban water services through management contracts
in 2001. In Uganda, only 60% of urban areas and 55% of rural areas have access to improved water services. Against
this background, this paper reports on research undertaken in Uganda, with the objective of analysing the performance of
management contracts in the recent and still on-going reform and private sector participation process of the water sector.
The research, which was undertaken as part of an MSc study, followed a case study methodology, and comprised a literature
review, customer surveys, focussed group discussions and key informant interviews. The paper presents the research
findings, and concludes that well planned and designed management contracts can potentially improve performance of
small towns water systems for the benefit of the users of services."

demonstrate low levels of sustainability. In addition to operational problems with the pump, the borehole itself may cease
to provide adequate quantities of safe drinking water only a short time after construction. This can have a significant
negative impact on poor rural communities, particularly in the dry season when alternative water sources are scarce. A
study of 302 boreholes in Ghana aimed to investigate rapid-onset borehole failure in relation to field data typically available
following drilling and development. The study showed that the likelihood of borehole failure increased by a factor of
six when drilling occurred during the wet season, and discovered a strong correlation between monthly precipitation and
respective failure rates for boreholes drilled in each month. The potential for borehole failure also increased significantly
when the initial yield was below the guideline value of 10 l/min. There was no indication, however, that a higher guideline
value would be a cost-effective measure to reduce failure rates."

vacuum in this field, which needs to be filed with better planning. There are many aspects of rural life in the Northern
Areas and Chitral region of Pakistan where people have unhygienic traditional practices. Unfortunately, sometimes these
unhygienic practices are linked with beliefs and religions. Some people for example believe that all flowing water is clean
i.e. river; channels etc. regardless of its source. Also, cloths after washing with soap are not considered clean (Paak) if
not dipped in water at least one meter deep. Women are main procurer and user of water and entirely responsible for
sanitation and hygiene of the family at home. In many parts of northern areas, acute shortage of water, ignored sanitation
and hygiene have made life difficult for women. A water and sanitation programme, should therefore involve women in
the development process. The central role of women in water, sanitation and hygiene has been emphasized in throughout
WASEP’s five years progamme. WASEP has been aiming to provide safe water at injection rather than at source or at tap

communities, both rural and high-density peri-urban, need to be supported in ways that will stimulate social cohesion
and result in group decisions being taken. Such cohesion and the building of social capital can ensure that peer pressure
comes to bear and poor hygiene practices can thus be challenged. This paper considers several approaches to Hygiene

now relies on it for there daily needs. As a free and easily tapped commodity, groundwater today is used in a wide variety
of uses. Of the 300 urban and rural piped water supply schemes operating across the country, almost one – third of them
rely entirely on groundwater. The volume they withdraw exceeds over 16 million cubic meters per year, which includes
supply to many industrial zones and urban and rural centers. And the volume of groundwater abstracted by around 11
million individual domestic users (out of the 13 million people with no access to piped water) is estimated at around 400
Mm3/yr. In some parts of the country including many locations in Kandy and Colombo, high pumping rates have lowered
the groundwater table, causing the wells to go dry and affecting the natural water courses including those used for drinking.
If these situations get worse, water shortages could become severe, especially during the more frequent extended frequent
dry spells being experienced, possibly due to climate change. Further, water pollution from domestic, agricultural and
industrial sources is contaminating the surface water and groundwater and affecting the environment and further placing
more pressure on the available water resource. Therefore in this paper identifies several critical issues as urgent challenges

retrieval problems. Therefore it is required to develop a Geo-database to efficiently manage these data. It is not feasible
to utilize available commercial Geo-databases for this purpose due to their high purchasing and maintenance costs. As a
solution PostgreSql, a free Open Source Object Relational Database Management System(ORDBMS) was selected. PostgreSql
has a module called PostGIS which handles spatial data and is used by hundreds of similar organization around the

The fixed assets consists of property, plant and equipment. Property includes land and any improvements done for
them. Plant includes the origin of manufacturing process used to house the production equipment. Equipment includes
the machinery and other items that are that are necessary for the operation of the business.
The fixed assets register is a very important document for every organization. The information such as asset identification

This rapid urbanisation has resulted in overstressing of existing water supply systems, with a loss of recharge areas and an
increased depletion of groundwater. These effects have further aggravated the urban water crisis. During the monsoons,
the existing drainage systems are overloaded and overflow thereby resulting in flooding causing severe damage to property.
Sewage overflows often lead to the outbreak of epidemics and occasionally to the loss of life. Rainwater harvesting
systems serve the dual purpose of water storage to reduce urban runoff peak flows as well as augmentation of the existing
water supply systems. To achieve minimum costs while optimising the security of supply, rainwater tanks need to be sized
taking the local rainfall conditions into consideration. This paper presents a methodology to determine the optimal size of
rooftop storage based on historical rainfall data. Annual savings of in-house demand as well as the security of rainwater
supply are discussed. The methodology is applied to Colombo in Sri Lanka. A case study is based on 150lpd household

areas, and in order to evaluate the potential of these coastal aquifers (before launching a well implementation program),
one need to locate the extent of this saline water intrusion. This information can be obtained by intrusive means such as

on the one hand and increased transparency and accountability on the other. Practices in India and Africa show that this
is often not the case. Accountability and transparency are sometimes lost when the contractual arrangements between
decentralised government and the private sector actors do not lead to involvement and informing user communities and
when the role of local NGO’s is not recognised. As a result the quality of some work is poor, ownership of WASH services
is low, and the equity principle is compromised. Nevertheless, these same decentralisation and privatisation processes
create opportunities to empower communities and develop measures to combat private gain and increase transparency

predicted during aeration may not be achieved for iron and manganese if some other oxygen consuming
substances are present in the raw water. Manganese removal is noted to be generally inefficient if aeration

such systems, pH of the effluent reduces as the water treatment process progresses. This results in dissolution
of manganese and iron flocs formed and a short filter run."

water supply and sanitation (RWSS). Attempts have been made to articulate WRM at global level culminating
into the development of the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) approach defined by
the Dublin Principles. However, these principles still need to be reflected in local actions that are used to
implement the RWSS interventions. Hence, this paper focuses on identifying the extent to which IWRM is
reflected in the RWSS implementation approach in Zambia known as the WASHE concept. The results of
this assessment show that only two out of the four Dublin principles are adequately reflected in the WASHE
concept. It is concluded that there is a need to integrate ground water management in IWRM and adapt
catchment management to existing administrative governance systems in Zambia, and that the WASHE

very different local circumstances. Little, if any, real linkage and upscaling
has taken place, to draw
conclusions that would fit all circumstances. A study was conducted in Nakuru municipality using structured
questionnaires. Results from the data analysis indicated that majority of the households interviewed had low
monthly incomes ranging between Kshs. 500010000.
Sanitation therefore was not a priority with this meager
income. The finding indicated that the only way these residents were willing to contribute to sanitation would
be in kind labour, 44%. Majority of Nakuru residents, 65% admitted that they don’t pay for garbage
collection services, reason being that of poverty and the notion that this is the responsibility of the municipal
council. On household improvement priority, many respondents, 35% would prefer to have water in their
residence followed closely with sanitation. They argue that with water availability, sanitation is guaranteed.
Potential financial constraints were identified as unwillingness and inability to pay due to poverty, lack of
political will and poor governance and low priority for sanitation in public sector spending due to competing
interest with other sectors such as health and education."

potentially be used depending on local availability in a particular area. Some examples of effective HWT
are biosand filters, ceramic filters, SODIS, combined flocculationchlorination

water sources with high turbidity (seasonally or year round) the effectiveness of the HWT approach
under high turbidity conditions should be considered as part of selecting the appropriate HWT approach.
Biosand filters, ceramic filters, flocculationchlorination,
and SODIS are effective at removing or
inactivating Cryptosporidium and pathogenic bacteria commonly associated with persistent diarrhea
depending on the turbidity of the water source. Combining chlorination with a preceding turbidity and
Cryptosporidium oocyst removal step potentially provides optimal HWT for people living with HIV/AIDS."

improve people’s access to water. However, many of the constructed water sources have broken down or

ambitiously set and inaccurately measured. This paper proposes a new way of measuring the impact of
investments. Assessing investments in “waterpersonyears”
over a defined period of time, allows for a
more efficient allocation of resources, and calls for a rethinking of the current development approach.
Measuring in waterpersonyears

The linkages between poverty and disability are strong, with disability being both the cause and effect of poverty. Without specific activities to address the requirements of people with disabilities the cycle of poverty remains, further exacerbated by continued exclusion from services such as health care, education and water and sanitation.

The objective of this study is to identify different strategies for deploying the test and assess how each might be affected by the test’s accuracy. Evidence on the H2S test’s accuracy is drawn from a recent systematic review. We identified six different strategies for deploying the test based on a literature review. Three strategies used the H2S test in isolation, while the other three used the H2S test in combination with standard, laboratory-based methods or alongside sanitary risk inspection surveys. We conclude that using the test in combination with laboratory-based methods or sanitary risk inspections reduces the problems posed by false positive H2S test results.

Water is addressed, among other items, by ready to use treatment plants; hygiene is addressed by pre-positioned NFI kits and promotion material such as posters, leaflets…The sanitation part of the package is less well equipped in terms of kits: there are the ready-to-use squatting slabs as a starting point but a latrine is comprised of a pit, a slab and a superstructure. Pit latrines and defecation trenches can be used only in areas where it is possible to dig. In areas where it is not possible to dig (urban settings, flood prone areas…), other solutions must be employed: among them, portable latrines such as the ones rented by Catholic Relief Service and operated by Action Contre la Faim in Port-au-Prince where found to be an expensive but however a good solution.

The spread and acceptability of CLTS among stakeholders within the short time of introduction is encouraging and based on the achievements recorded so far, the approach has the potentials of accelerating sanitation delivery in Nigeria."

Several attempts made in the past to rehabilitate these UWI have not positively changed their level of deteriorations. Presently, their overall assessment grade is best described as fairly poor as most of these assets have only 10 -35% of their expected useful life remaining, low capacity utilization and assets require a significant level of maintenance. Consequently, their service delivery and coverage has been so poor across the country resulting in various environmental and socio-economical problems which have been of great concern. Hence this paper is focused at highlighting and discussing the issues and challenges of these decaying water assets in PWUs in Nigeria."

A sample of 216 was considered from 547 households that use Fossa alterna latrines, since they were introduced by WaterAid in Ethiopia project. The study used both qualitative and quantitative research to capture data. The study in the area has found that Ecological Sanitation (EcoSan) type-Fossa alterna technology has not been adopted as a way to sustainably manage human excreta in rural communities. Out of the sample of 216 households who had previously constructed Fossa alterna latrines only 25% are currently functional, 45% have replaced them with traditional pit latrines and very few households started linking Fossa alterna latrines with farming. There were several major technical design problems that hindered sustainability of household Fossa alterna in the study area. During the design, the family size and their water use practices were not considered and partition of pits and basements were not made of waterproof materials. Other factors included lack of awareness about operation and management, capital costs, the high management burden on women and girls, absence of coordinated effort among stakeholders, and lack of attention to sanitation by local community-based organisations."

These quantitative estimates of filter use are compared against different measures of self-reported filter use. Tally counters were also investigated as an alternative to simple self-reported filter usage. Comparison to datalogger records shows that tally counters underreport the frequency of filter filling, while household reports of filling frequency matched rather closely. However, households report treating much larger volumes of water than were calculated from datalogger records. Datalogger records indicate consumption of approximately 12.5 litres per day per filter, or 2.0 litres per person per day, which is probably adequate for drinking but not for cooking."

Study results find no relationship between the distance from a community to the nearest spare parts retailer and the duration of a pump breakdown, nor that access to spare parts is a key limiter of waterpoint functionality. Findings suggest that community ownership, organization, and willingness to repair a waterpoint are the most significant factors affecting how quickly a pump is repaired.

Firstly, decision-making is more complex because consensus needs to be reached among a diverse group of people with a varied level of understanding of ecological and sustainable concepts. Secondly, the technological challenge is more complex in MDMH due to the more intricate physical connections of a shared Ecosan system. Thirdly, the challenge of management is more complex as responsibility for maintenance and emptying of bins is shared among groups of families or units.

Program designers such as national governments and major donors can encourage good management by creating incentives and systems for project implementation that encourage these behaviours in districts. Furthermore, program designers should recognize that a lack these incentives and systems discourages good management in districts, and that effective CLTS implementation cannot happen without good management behaviours."

Nevertheless, they are often excluded from development intervention and research . In response, WaterAid in Ethiopia designed a pilot project to meet the needs of disabled people within their service delivery work. Learning gained through the project informed WaterAid’s global equity and inclusion approach. In 2010, a formative evaluation of WaterAid’s pilot project in Ethiopia was conducted, along with an extensive review of relevant literature, including an assessment of four case studies of World Vision’s projects, semi-structured interviews and participant observation. This paper gives an overview of the research and draws out key principles and practices for development organisations aiming to empower disabled people."

Data were collected from 785 households using structured interviews. According to the results obtained, 43–83% of the population use solar water disinfection (SODIS) and 16–79% use boiling as a water treatment option 1–4 years after project completion. However, since 25–86% of the people still consume untreated water, follow-up campaigns should be conducted in some areas. Based on the individual factors influencing SODIS use, future campaigns in mainly rural areas should team up with government institutions, target people's emotions and intentions to treat water, support habit development, and make use of social norms."

Traditionally supplied by shallow wells, at the outbreak of civil war the program of reticulated supply development collapsed, and the town has since reverted to an un-centralized network of wells, small scale reticulated distribution systems and vendors, with limited water treatment options. Access to sufficient safe affordable water is biased disproportionately against the poorest. The trend of well expansion driven by diaspora/national investment and humanitarian/aid programs continues. Although a planning framework is coming into place to address rehabilitation of a centrally regulated system required in the future, taking account of uncertainty, purposive research has produced an inference-based analysis. A fresh problem statement underpinning national efforts to improve prospects for sustainable water supply development for Mogadishu has been framed."

Philip",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/30956","","Most studies of access to water by the poor focus on their ‘primary’ source of drinking water. Even on this count, in sub-Saharan Africa, 30% of urban households rely directly on water from wells. However, this only tells part of the story. The work of Practical Action and our project partners in Kisumu has revealed how poor urban households rely on a diverse range of water sources of differing quality and price for different uses (drinking, cooking and washing).We find that 45% of households in 4 informal settlements in Kisumu are using borehole or surface water for at least some of their needs. Access to these sources is an important part of their coping strategies when there is a shortage of piped water or when household circumstances change. However, the quality and accessibility of the water can be poor. Improving access not only to piped water, but also to good quality water from protected springs, shallow wells and community-managed boreholes, can have great benefits in particular for women. This paper illustrates the diverse benefits that can accrue, and highlights some of the policy issues that arise."

It is a Strategy that has had unprecedented outcomes in motivating rural communities to transform from a haven of open defecation to clean environments where all households now have and use latrines. This is the experience in rural communities of Birniwa Local government of Jigawa State where open defecation was a norm and was never connected to the prevalent cases of diarrhea especially among children. Even though, there had been several health enforcement interventions by the sanitary Inspectors of the LGA for people to build latrines, yet the practice of open defecation persisted. This situation remained until CLTS was introduced and implemented through UNICEF/DFID supported Sanitation, Hygiene and Water in Nigeria (SHAWN) aimed at promoting mass safe excreta disposal campaign, first among households and then to communities taking charge of their sanitation. Introduction of CLTS helped so many communities to construct latrines and open defecation was gradually becoming history. Suddenly, latrines began to collapse and open defecation crawled its back into nerve center of communities especially communities with loose soil formation.
The onus was now on us to find lasting solution to this challenge. A forum of local artisans was organized by the affected communities from which various local latrine options emerged for demonstration and adaptation. A demonstration center was supported by UNICEF for all communities to visit and borrow the most affordable option for their communities. Once again, this initiative has brought back smiles into faces of householders who were disappointed at the negative experience of collapsing latrines. Now, CLTS is back on its track."

For schools and other institutions where hundreds of children, teachers and staff rely on often only one water point for drinking, hand washing and cleaning this poses many challenges. Queues decrease students’ daily consumption of water and time in the classroom, hand washing is difficult to practice and bathing stalls often go unused. In 2006 one of WaterCan’s Ethiopian partners Rural Community Water Development Organization (COWDO) developed a new and innovate design for hand dug and borehole water systems to address the specific water and sanitation needs of primary students in Ethiopia. Using an elevated hand pump and attaching a 250-500 litre water storage tank COWDO has addressed the challenges above, and is now a resource for others wishing to use similar designs."

The overwhelming opinion is that the only sustainable way of preventing outbreaks is by decent water supplies, sanitation and hygiene behaviour, yet WASH actors do not appear to be active in the fight against the disease, with initial responses being led by medical issues. The concept of the disaster cycle should lead from relief to recovery to prevention, but the handover from emergency response to development is weak, made worse by the transfer of the lead agency from health to WASH, with differing priorities, actions and data needs. The idea of early recovery tries to bring “development” closer to the emergency response but this leads to blurred boundaries and ill-defined responsibilities.

In Somaliland, community role in rural water supply management is not clear in the national water policy and poorly regulated, this undermined the acceptability of the local community's willingness to participate meaningfully in the rural water supply system. Moreover, In terms of capacity development, different sectorial staff may have received several training workshops, but what often not done well is looking at impact of training workshops, seminars and short courses for local authority staff, NGO personnel as well as the village level committee members. This paper is aimed to discuss the current community managed rural water supply management option and strategies for capacity development. Therefore, this paper is looking at the generic management models and their relevance to Somaliland."

A resilience based approach in emergency operations has the ability to improve operations, stimulate recovery, ensure effective exit and transition mechanisms and leave sustainable solutions for rehabilitation; offering the ability to increase coherence between relief, recovery and development. The current financial and operational framework the humanitarian sector operates under sees these activities separated into 'phases' along a continuum with many agencies deeming any form of 'recovery' activity outside their mandate. But continual challenges with transition, exits, incidence of unnecessary protracted reliefs and consequential negative impacts on society, are a strong indicator of a need to re-evaluate the current emergency paradigm. It is argued that Resilience Building Initiatives (RBIs) have the ability to operationalize resilience in the post-disaster context."

It draws on doctoral fieldwork which adopts a feminist approach using the mixed methods of participant observation, questionnaire survey and interviews. The survey included questions on age, gender, education, marital status, and years on the job, ethnicity, working hours, income, and family data, such as number of children and other family income earners. The findings revealed the impact of gender on livelihood strategies. Age, marital status, religion, ethnic origin, working hours and income are some of the characteristics which were found to differ by gender among waste workers. In terms of earning capacity, the average mean income of all the workers was greater than the minimum wage as at the time of the study. This paper calls for an inclusive policy design which integrates the informal waste sector, bridges gender differences and also promotes sustainable development."

Average T-N removal efficiencies of each period increased from 38 % to 67 %, 72 %, 74 % to 75 % with stepwise increases in volumetric T-N loading rates. A T-N removal rate of 2.8 kg N/m3/day was obtained after 240 days of operation. After 3 months, anammox biomass fully covered the surface of the PE sponge carrier and the color of the material changed from white to red. Following 5 months of operation, biomass proliferated on the surface of the material and a dark-red color was observed. These results shown that anammox process using PE sponge materials as biomass carriers in the fixed-bed reactor will be suitable for NH4-N removal from wastewater containing high NH4-N. However, it is necessary to investigate whether PE sponge material can operate under high organic carbon concentrations in anammox process, because these wastewaters always contain high concentration of organic matter."

Results show that the two locally produced adsorbents have a similar efficiency to commercial activated carbon for adsorption. The removal efficiency was somewhat lower for both materials, but in the same order of magnitude. The removal of pesticides and organic matter with a column filled with activated carbon derived from bamboo was found the best among the two locally produced materials, approximately 30% and 23% higher than those observed for the column filled with activated carbon from coconut shells. It concludes that bamboo-derived activated carbon adsorption can be employed on an alternative to commercial activated carbon and could be a feasible option for drinking water treatment."

As the success of a decision is also dependent on the applied methodology, the present work aimed at analysing: i) their objectives and area of application; ii) the way the decision processes are structured; and iii) the stakeholders’ involvement. It was found that the types of selection procedures vary, as well as the technologies under consideration. Used criteria are wide in terms of sustainability dimensions, being either predefined or defined during the decision process. Stakeholders’ involvement is clearly a priority in analysed DSM, although differing in range and in the way they are involved. In conclusion, it is believed that learning from experiences of applied DSM will help to better select and adapt them to other contexts."

Notwithstanding that, there are also some cases of success. In this paper, the authors argue that very often the main challenge facing utilities is not the development of utility competences per se, but their actual use. Drawing on the case of Uganda's National Water and Sewerage Corporation, we identify and discuss five interrelated factors that have allowed the corporation to progressively turn its knowledge base into improved performance, by means of its change management programmes.

Examples from Malawi, notably from Nkhotakota District, suggest possible methods for improving this probability of pump repairs through strengthening local stakeholder relationships, which may hold greater potential for improving infrastructure sustainability than the temporary benefits typified by direct project interventions."

Of particular concern is the situation of small island developing states where the impacts of water scarcity will be more pronounced. This case study investigated the effectiveness of the water tariff as an economic instrument for water demand management in the urban municipality of Gros Islet, Saint Lucia. Survey results compared with administrative data from the water utility show that the water tariff was effective, to a smaller extent, at reducing household water consumption with the help of public education and awareness campaigns. External economic pressures brought to bear by the Value Added Tax also contributed. Given the high consumers’ willingness to conserve and pay for water, it is recommended that the water utility carries out a detailed study with the objective of designing a tariff structure that better reflects marginal cost pricing."

These were a carbonaceous solid material i.e. char with a high calorific value which can be used as a fuel or soil conditioner, and liquid ammonia concentrate for fertilizer. The results of this study provide useful information essential for the design and operation of a HTC system (for faecal sludge treatment) which will be integrated into a self-sustainable sanitation facility planned for protoype development."

Sohail (Khan)",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/33509","","Lagos, a city in southwest Nigeria, has been identified as one of the fastest growing cities in the world. The problem of waste management has led to various initiatives to tackle the mounting heaps of waste in Nigeria’s cities. The government has supported the introduction of the private sector in waste collection. However, the process of solid waste management does not stop with waste collection. With the gap created in the waste management process, transportation of waste to dump sites provides the informal waste sector with a source of livelihood. This paper reports on fieldwork that incorporates observation, and qualitative research methods. The findings reveal gender differences in the livelihoods available to women in the informal waste sector, specifically focusing on waste scavengers, based on tool usage and waste specialization."

The challenges of implementation include dealing with a large number of small towns (about 400 WCAs (Water Consumers Associations)) and strengthening the WCAs to move from the nurturing state to self reliance. Donor agencies have played proactive roles in supporting the small town reforms. One lesson is that for access in water and sanitation to be improved, policies need to focus more on small towns but these communities will need to be nurtured to address cost recovery and supported through structures at state level like STOWA (Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Agency) in Jigawa state and at Local Government levels like the proposed Local Government WASH departments.. The next step of whether the WCAs can delegate responsibility of water supply operation to local private operators, remains to be seen."

Findings demonstrate that the inclusive WASH approach has improved vulnerable people’s WASH access, though barriers still exist. The approach may have had a positive impact on stigma and discrimination, dignity and self-esteem of vulnerable individuals, but older people continue to face disproportionate levels of discrimination due to decreased mobility and ill health. Vulnerable people’s participation in the intervention is lower than expected, though activities to improve this have been identified.

Our observation is that too often the focus appears to be on the tools themselves or on the ability to collect data in a different way – and not sufficiently on what the data gets used for (or how the provision of data can actually change the dynamics on the ground). As a South African based company working in the ICT and water sectors, SeeSaw has good experience of designing and adapting ICT tools to support the WASH sector – we leverage this to suggest some early lessons and to suggest a slight ‘reality check’ to the implementation and adoption of ICT – making sure that the positive contributions are not lost through poor design or over-ambitious approaches."

The Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) is a strategic intervention for promoting exclusive breastfeeding with emphasis on the community level intervention.
Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) motivates communities to stop open defecation and become environments where all households use latrines.
Combining the two strategies is an offshoot of partnership between UNICEF WASH and Nutrition sections playing very important role in the Child Survival and Development cluster. This intervention promotes messages of exclusive breastfeeding; safe defecation and hand washing with the aim of preventing malnutrition from the onset. Area of synergy between the two sections could be summarized as: good hygiene is crucial to avoid diarrhoea and other illnesses. In communities targeted, all households now use latrines while practice of hand washing after defecation has increased."

However there are concerns as to the effect on the human right to water as well as on the viability of the approach to water service providers on scale. The paper presents findings from a World Bank study in eight African countries using on-site data collection, key informant interviews, 27 focus groups and 1,180 household surveys in three countries. The study found that customers appreciate the convenience and believe that prepaid systems have enabled them to manage household expenses better, reducing the risk of incurring debt or disconnection. However, although many utilities believe the benefits outweigh the costs, they report that the robustness of prepaid meters varies at present varies considerably, leaving utilities too reliant on technical support from suppliers, which is not always timeously available. Initial capital costs are also relatively high."

Eco-San systems, especially Urine-Diverting Dry Toilets (UDDTs), have been promoted in Uganda since 1997. However, uptake remains low, and pit latrines continue to be the most common sanitation technology in the country. This paper provides a general comparison of pit latrines, UDDTs, and an alternative Eco-San option known as the sawdust bucket system. The comparison accounts for several factors related to installation, operation, user comfort, and technical issues. The two Eco-San systems were found to provide benefits beyond those of pit latrines, and the bucket system was the most favourable of the three. However, each Eco-San system has distinct advantages in different contexts, and it is recommended that multiple Eco-San options be promoted. Given freedom of choice, consumers can select the option most appropriate for their specific contexts and needs."

With subsidies and/or micro credits families can be stimulated to make their own wells for domestic and productive use. Support Self-supply is not instead of the conventional subsidised Communal water supply but an additional approach with the advantage of the income generating effect of water at family level and families willing to invest. A range of new, innovative and low cost technologies have made Self-supply affordable, so where technically possible, it makes sense to stimulate Self-supply. By using household water treatment, water from Self-supply sources can be made safe to drink. The right Self-supply approach will result in safe drinking water, more water for productive use, local business development, increased income for users and more food security."

Contrary to the research hypothesis, which is that in these successful cases a significant amount of on-going specialist support will be found, the findings to date are showing a considerable level of support in the project implementation stage but a limited amount of specialist support in the service delivery and capital maintenance phases. However, in many of the cases, the close integration of community management in the prevailing system of local government, particularly the Gram Panchayats, creates an underlying mechanism for support during the service delivery phase. Whilst this arrangement has pragmatic benefits, it also raises questions about the boundaries between what constitutes community management and public service provision, as well as about the lines of accountability between communities, service providers and local governments."

The Nano Membrane toilet has many design aspects that will involve interaction by the end-user, including water reuse from the membrane treatment system which produces treated water directly available to the user at household level. In order to maintain a user focused design development, a survey was carried out on potential end users in Kumasi, Ghana, in order to understand their attitudes to direct reuse of water from the toilet, and how the attitudes may be affected by aesthetic changes to the water. It was found that end users would be willing to use the product water for a wide range of household purposes, with cleaning being the most likely. Odour was found to have the greatest effect over taste and colour on user’s willingness for all potential purposes, including drinking, cooking, and teeth cleaning."

The study a) tested the influence of ten proximate determinants of water point functionality, and b) critically examined the social, economic and political dynamics underlying these factors, especially the community management model. The data shows that the key influences on sustainability are water point type and installation quality (technical factors) and availability of funds, skills, and incidence of theft (management factors). Misuse of funds by water point committees emerges as a particular problem. These results are driven by the way that community management structures interact with socially embedded institutions and power dynamics. The findings challenge the assumptions of efficiency and empowerment that underpin the community management model, and show that in fact it frequently generates conflict and reproduces inequality at community level."

At the national level, this often translates into the requirement to allocate additional funding to new infrastructure and in rural areas, this investment focuses mainly on water points and occasionally on small scale piped schemes. The assumption is that investment in infrastructure will lead to widespread use by households, attracted by convenience and quality of service. A recent survey from IRC in Burkina Faso, demonstrates that this is not always the case and a large proportion of households either compliment their domestic water consumption at informal water points, or rely on them for all their needs.

her journey from child to womanhood. Though this time period is quite crucial for a young girl, standing
all alone she faces the first encounter all by herself amid the culture of silence or half baked knowledge
which transgresses into various repercussions up to the end of her reproductive life. Menstrual health is
a major area of concern in reproductive health affecting a large number of women starting from
adolescence. Menstrual hygiene and management have direct consequences on fertility and reproductive
tract infections respectively and effects on school absenteeism. This paper presents how government
programs are limited to distribution of napkins lacking awareness building and environment creation.
Government programs lack convergence, holistic approach. The role of development organizations is to
strengthen the program, need of convergence among departments and how to do it."

This paper explores who is to carry out these activities, and how they might be motivated and financed. It argues for the importance of identifying existing administrative and social structures prior to implementation. Looking at reasons for success in Nambale sub-county, which was declared ODF in 2012, the paper discusses the role of Community Health Workers (CHWs), who, under the Kenyan Community Health Strategy Approach (CHSA) have an expanded remit that includes CLTS, in follow-up and in reaching the poorest and most marginalised within communities. The paper highlights challenges which have arisen, such as incentives to motivate CHWs, as well as the risk that devolved government structures lead to inequity among districts, and varying levels of funding for the same activities, thereby threatening ODF achievement and sustainability."

However, chlorine-based disinfectants are thought to rapidly lose their bactericidal and virucidal properties in contact with high levels of organic matter and chlorine application results in the production of toxic chlororganic compounds. To evaluate the disinfection efficacy of chlorine solutions (HTH, NaDCC and household bleach) against viruses and bacteria within excreta matrices, laboratory-scale disinfection experiments were undertaken. Human excreta matrices containing raw wastewater, with 0%, 10% and 20% (w/v) added faecal sludge, were disinfected with chlorine solutions at a ratio of 1:10 (chlorine solution: excreta matrix). Contact time was set at 30 minutes and bacterial (FC and IE) and viral (SOMPH) indicators were used to measure disinfection efficacy. Results demonstrated that at high levels of solids content, disinfection efficacy was significantly reduced. These results support the need to find a more effective means of disinfecting human excreta in future Ebola outbreaks."

This particularly affects the sanitation sector. In Lebanon for example, despite the millions of dollars invested by donors during the last decades to improve the sanitation system, only 8% of wastewater is currently treated. This is partly due to the same problems that occur in most development projects.

Many of the parameters of interest for FS rely on gravimetric methods of measurement (e.g. total solids, total volatile solids, etc.). As such, they require the use of weighing scales of sufficient reliability, accuracy and precision. Laboratory-grade analytical scales can be difficult to use in remote areas because of their bulk and price point. This study aims to compare two relatively low-cost, off-the-shelf electronic scales to a laboratory-grade analytical (reference) scale. Three scales were compared using their bias, load eccentricity errors and sensitivity errors. The comparison showed that the low-cost scales exhibit a positive bias and are more prone to eccentricity errors than the reference scale. However, they perform well enough to warrant further investigation into whether they can be an acceptable alternative to laboratory scales in field or low-resource settings for faecal sludge characterization."

One concern with shared facilities is difficulty in cleanliness, and a lacuna exists in shared sanitation quality in informal settlements. This study investigated the quality of shared sanitation in informal settlements of Kisumu city in Kenya. Data was collected by interviewing users, and by inspecting sanitation facilities for aspects of quality. The facilities were all pit latrines, most of which offered privacy, but were not hygienically clean. Cleanliness deteriorated with more households sharing, indicating that less attention was given to keeping shared facilities clean. Improvement strategies in informal settlements should not only focus on access but also target group behaviour and practices among shared sanitation users."

Notwithstanding significant success in decreasing open-air defecation, CLTS still faces many challenges, and its impacts and sustainability are limited by competing approaches, fall-backs (“slippage”) and difficulties to “move up the sanitation ladder” and sustain achievements over time. This article argues that instead of considering CLTS and traditional subsidized approaches as opposing, these approaches should be seen as complementary as they address different links of the same chain: while CLTS boosts demand creation, subsidized approaches increase supply. These approaches, together with new techniques such as sanitation marketing, should therefore be smartly combined to address the whole sanitation services chain and therefore achieve sustainable access to improved sanitation."

However, in Malawi, only financial self-sufficiency and decentralized day-to-day management of DWS services are considered when assessing the likelihood of a sustainable service system. However, the definition of sustainability has developed further to include societal aspects of sustainable development; namely “social sustainability”. Therefore, though financial and managerial facets of DWS service sustainability are important, if there are weak social relations between the DWS service and consumers, this will potentially threaten long term growth due to inadequate legitimacy to make social settlements for service expansions that could benefit more households. This paper will attempt to illustrate two years’ worth of research that was purposefully conducted to gain an understanding of the condition of social relations between water consumers and Water Users Associations in peri-urban Malawi."

PPP is relatively new concept to Somaliland in the Water Sector and has shown potential to be scaled up. This paper will compare and contrast the public sector agency and PPP models in two towns in Somaliland. Often, fragile countries like Somaliland lack the capacity and will for sustainability. The Ministry of Water Resources and UNICEF, under a four year EU funded project “Improving Urban Water Service Delivery in Somaliland”, have worked together with the respective municipal authorities to develop both models. The key focus of this project included management and operational issues, regulatory framework and performance monitoring of water service providers, capacity development and Pro-Poor regulatory measures. It aims to ensure that well-planned investment in more efficient water systems in selected towns is underpinned by a common, Somaliland-wide approach to service delivery with better public-private arrangements, a more capable public oversight, and a stronger focus on service delivery to the most vulnerable. Recent research, commissioned under the project, demonstrates that both models are viable. In the case of the public utility model in Burao, it almost collapsed in 2010 due poor management if it were not for the timely intervention of the Ministry of Water Resources. The PPP model introduced in Boroma town since 2003 has worked relatively well but the need to review the performance monitoring and pro-poor regulatory measures were recognized in 2013.

The city of Accra has been chosen as a case study due to its status as a coastal capital in the global south where major global trends such as climate change and rapid urbanization intersect. Water as a natural resource, we content, is not only of great importance for the sustainability of ecosystems and socioeconomic systems. Flows and uses of water are also bound to questions of politics, security and accessibility. However, in spite of these interrelated social and biophysical challenges we maintain that Water Studies as a field of research is still surprisingly disciplinary in its approach and scientific outlook.

Also, the risk of salinisation of wells was assessed by means of numerical modelling combined with data provided from a groundwater monitoring network. Groundwater recharge estimates yielded 50 to 100 times higher values than previous studies, suggesting a multi-layered aquifer system. Since abstractions are concentrated within only one aquifer horizon of the system, they were found to be close to recharge rates.

With the current few wastewater treatment plants in the country, this intervention would require more 36 faecal sludge plants to be constructed across the country. The current conventional plants seem very costly and at times underutilised because very few serious entrepreneurs would move all the distance to a safe disposal site. As a result there is illegal dumping in bushes. Water For People has developed sustainable sanitation business model right from capture structures through emptying with gulpers, transport with tricycles, pick-ups to low cost decentralised faecal sludge treatment (DEFAST) and Reuse of faecal sludge (FS) as briquettes, feeds, Vermicompost/compost, Biochar."

Findings showed that tariffs were set by water supply design consultants and operators in consultation with the community. Revenue collected in two systems recovered the operation and maintenance costs. The on-going use of alternative sources was found to undermine cost recovery and highlighted intermittent water supply and high tariffs. Users perceived good water supply service as a form of accountability for revenue as more important than the provision of information about revenue and expenditure."

This paper assesses the influence on-site sanitation facilities have on groundwater quality by determining the level and source of contamination and identifying the associated pathways to contamination at various levels of storage. Groundwater samples from randomly selected sources with different storage levels were analysed for physio-chemical parameters, microbial contamination levels and the presence of heavy metals. The risk to contamination of selected sources was conducted using a questionnaire developed by Howard et al. The results indicate that, groundwater quality deteriorates from source to storage with counts of microbes increasing. However, as microbial contamination level increases, risk to contamination levels decreases for primary and secondary storage. This suggests that, contamination at primary and secondary storage levels is not directly from on-site sanitation systems but from other identified factors."

needs of women in public spaces were related to high demand for exclusive toilets for women with specific facilities and caretakers who collect money and keep the toilets clean, with particular need for women caretakers to add to the feeling of security. A strong need greater number of well-maintained sanitation facilities in places such as bus stops and railway stations and access to the toilets from main roads rather from interior roads were other aspects that emerged."

transgender). Solutions range from ‘gender-neutral’ public toilets, to ‘third gender’ ones, as well as
ensuring transgender people can access toilets matching their gender identity. But there is no clear
consensus. Overwhelmingly, the review reinforced how little is known about the challenges LGBTI face

The primary barrier to wide scale adoption of solar water pumping is that policy makers and practitioners at the local, national and international levels lack valid and transparent information on performance in a broad range of contexts and of the full life-cycle costs. In an attempt to fill this information gap, this paper presents upfront and recurring costs from 85 rural solar water pumping schemes of various sizes that have been designed, constructed and supported by Water Mission in eight countries. The average life-cycle costs associated with the reviewed schemes were within and on the lower end of IRC WASHCost benchmark ranges for both piped water schemes and boreholes fitted with handpumps. These findings indicate solar pumping is a viable and cost-effective intervention for rural water supply."

The study showed that 96.5 % of households were using toilets while the remaining 3.5% were defecating in open. The study confirms creation of new social norms which contributed to uptake and use of toilets at large scale. The study also identified major areas for improvement and proposes critical recommendations to address them. Major findings from the study are presented in this paper."

The nutrient content, calorific value and thermal properties were determined for faecal sludge samples dried at different moisture contents, in two different drying apparatus, one based on convective drying and the other on infrared drying. The results show that the nutrient content and calorific value were not affected during drying. On the contrary, drying modified the chemical form of nitrogen in the sludge, by binding it more tightly to the solid structure. Moreover, drying led to the increase of the thermal diffusivity, which improves its quality as biofuel by enhancing its ability to conduct heat. Faecal sludge, after being dried, could be used in agriculture as an organic fertilizer of slow nitrogen and phosphorous release, and as a biofuel with similar characteristics than wood."

The crop growth sub-model was successful and met all statistical criteria (r2 > 0.8 and D > 0.8). Use of DEWATS effluent showed to increase soil inorganic N and P within the top soil layers (0.3 m), which may be beneficial for crop production. However, proper management practices are recommended to prevent leaching and runoff losses."

Data was collected using observation and in-depth interviews. Twenty one out of 31 caregivers who participated in the study were biological mothers, the remaining were relatives or nonrelatives. Over half the infants had several alternative caregivers providing care in or outside the home. Food preparation and feeding was done by the caregiver providing care when the child was hungry. These findings imply that child care in the informal settlements is done by multiple caregivers, suggesting that food hygiene interventions should give attention to all likely child caregivers to reduce diarrheal disease."

All these make life for women in slums more complicated. The study aims at analysing various problems tackled by them and also the severity of the problem faced by them guides the policy makers to focus on the problems that need immediate action."

Few researchers to date have questioned why “Middle of the Pyramid” consumers with a regular monthly income ($4 to $50 per day) are not investing in sanitation as a priority. This paper seeks to understand how establishing a sanitation marketing activity at such a consumer’s place of work can be utilised as a point of sale to increase sanitation adoption. Critical findings from the study indicate that worksite sanitation marketing interventions are an effective tool to “trigger” salaried workers to move from non-adopters to adopters of sanitation at a household level. The research uncovers a clear opportunity for employers to establish enabling environments unblocking constraints to sanitation adoption, for example, by offering flexible payment plans."

In response, government of Ethiopia and its development partners have been using sanitation marketing to promote and sell WASH products. Qualitative in-depth interview with households, supply chain actors, and stakeholders were conducted in four regions of Ethiopia to learn about current product use behaviours. The result showed presence of any latrine was related to greater awareness about importance to health. Financial constraints, unavailability of construction materials were major barriers to possession of latrines. Word of mouth was the dominant source of information on WASH products, with health extension workers being a respected source. The major challenges of supply chain actors at district level were finance, inadequate working space, and lack of business development skills. Lack of regular WASH products supply system at community level and lack of profound awareness about health benefit were the priority constrains to access latrines."

Factors related to poor sanitation and hygiene practices among caregivers of children exposed to fecal contamination through their environs, and poor nutrition practices put children at risk for stunting. Despite their shared objectives, sanitation and nutrition programs are often implemented separately. The SanNut study explored whether an integrated sanitation and nutrition program piloted in Kitui County would lead to better sanitation and nutrition behaviours and practices among caregivers of young children compared to a standard sanitation program.

The 2010 earthquake in Haiti and subsequent cholera outbreak thus led to the implementation of numerous point-of-collection (PoC) and point-of-use (PoU) water treatment programs. We propose to present a synthesis of lessons learned from fifteen evaluations conducted in Haiti between 2010 and 2016, including four PoC and eleven PoU water treatment programs, to better understand which strategies have helped make programs effective and sustainable. Overall, it appears that PoU water treatment technologies were more effective than PoC water treatment programs in the Haitian context. Additionally, evaluation results suggest that programs achieving sustained effectiveness were those that:1) promoted technologies that were effective and familiar to beneficiaries; 2) had reliable supply chains for water treatment products; 3) worked with local partners; and, 4) included monitoring."

This paper shows that recent analytical work by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) at the Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO) WASH section in Nairobi has revealed that there is a methodological challenge in building a robust evidence on the impacts of improved WASH on educational and health outcomes. The paper reveals that there remain large gaps in data collection and monitoring processes and that as a result inhibit efforts to make concrete inferences on the impacts of WASH on educational and health outcomes."
"WEDC 41st International Conference","9593318","Equity and inclusion in WASH in Nepal: policy and practice","A. Kamal Adhikari, Dandi Ram Bishwakarma, Tameez Ahmad",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/35482","","The inclusive governance in Nepal's drinking water and sanitation sector is a recent phenomenon though several sector policies, plans and other framework had promoted gender, inclusion and community's leadership. The engagement of local level Water Users' and Sanitation Committees is an exclusive example of decentralized arrangement of community management in WASH. These national instruments had enabled inclusion of women and people from disadvantaged communities in the committees and advocated for equity in investment and service delivery. In the past, such policy provisions were poorly complied in the absence of high level political commitments, participatory planning, pragmatic guiding documents and robust monitoring frameworks. The prevailing wider gap in access to drinking water and sanitation services among different groups substantiates this fact. Systematic advocacy, capacity development, enforcement of constitutional and policy provisions, research and studies, review and reflections and knowledge sharing seems crucial to ensure equity and inclusion in the WASH sector."

However, the TWiG didn’t analyse past disasters and water borne epidemics together with endemic diseases, and this paper wants to identify if there are and which are the criteria and information to be considered to choose the best filter (or other water treatment) to be distributed. Even if further specific research is needed, it looks clear that the analysis of historical epidemics of waterborne diseases in the area of intervention, together with considerations about the general context and technical characteristics of the available treatment devices, can help to identify the best water treatment solutions."

Nyarko",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/35480","","Understanding the role of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services on menstrual hygiene behaviors and practices and ultimately on school absenteeism is important to inform policy and practice. This study focused on how the schools’ WASH infrastructure affects Menstrual Hygiene Management. The study was based on data from seven schools in the Weweso circuit, Kumasi-Ghana collected through Focus Group Discussions, key informant interviews and observation of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in the selected schools. Public schools (government managed) did not have adequate provision for menstrual hygiene management and the private schools (individually owned) had better WASH infrastructure/services that provide a better environment for menstrual hygiene management compared to the public schools. The poor WASH infrastructure in basic schools constrain school girls from maintaining good menstrual hygiene practices. The study recommends education on menstrual hygiene management and the incorporation of adequate consideration for menstrual hygiene management infrastructure in basic schools (primary school)."

The study shed light on key aspects and dynamics influencing local ownership, behaviour change and construction quality, and also revealed multifaceted exclusion processes. The immersive approach helped build trust with villagers and allowed a unique insight into the SBM in its ‘real life’ context, necessary to explore hidden dynamics and diverse perspectives, and understand the complexities involved. Despite some practical challenges, undertaking immersive studies and experiences would be beneficial for improving the Swachh Bharat Mission and other sanitation programmes. The approach could be adopted pragmatically, but always respecting some basic principles and ethical behavior."

The PRG laboratory team has offered their expertise to partner laboratories and played a pivotal role in developing faecal sludge (FS) laboratories through a capacity building programme in developing countries. The PRG has visited many laboratories where they assist with individualised programmes to set up or improve existing systems. This can include building an appropriate laboratory structure, establishing management systems, and improving health and safety when handling biologically hazardous material and the development of analytical methods. Laboratory management systems must be in place to govern laboratory processes as a whole. Laboratories should establish and follow health and safety procedures, laboratory management systems and standard operational protocols. There is a need for greater communication and collaboration between FS laboratories in developing countries to ensure best practice is shared and maintained."

Evidence for this and the practical budget, operational and management responsibilities are less clear. A three-country research project looking at the impact of lighting on WASH use and Gender- Based Violence (GBV) required a multi-disciplinary approach, combining OXFAM’s practical implementing expertise with WEDC’s research-orientated approach. The research showed how much more is needed for safe sanitation than just building latrines. Lack of usage of latrines had implications for environmental health. A reason for not using latrines was due to fear of many things, including GBV. The location of the facility was a common concern, but simple lessons are not easy to distil as the context varies between settlements and changes rapidly overtime. The provision of lighting was welcomed by a wide range of stakeholders, but other factors still affect both GBV and WASH outcomes."

Shaikh",2018,"https://hdl.handle.net/2134/34598","","Bangladesh has seen remarkable progress in sanitation coverage in recent decades. This paper looks at the sustainability of sanitation services at the grassroots level and how local government institutions have been involved or influenced to be active in addressing sanitation needs. Two Union Parishads in Bangladesh are taken as case studies to examine how NGOs have engaged with local government, what has been most effective for contributing to sustainability from local government and community perspectives and the available evidence for sustainability. Results show that local government institutions can generate sustained change with support from community-led approaches. The most effective elements of NGO support include activating a system of committees, generating a community-led social movement and the provision of information. The evidence for sustainability is promising, including continued use of hygienic sanitation facilities, increases in local government budget allocations for WASH and demand for improved services."

The WASH sector has paid attention to the menstrual hygiene management (MHM) needs of adolescent girls, whilst the MHM needs of perimenopausal women are ignored. Using narratives provided by women in Ghana through oral history interviews, participatory mapping and PhotoVoice, and using a vignette method to engage stakeholders, this paper discusses how MHM during the perimenopause is affected by inadequate sanitation provision. Sanitary materials which fail to provide effective menstrual protection also raise related issues of access to sanitation, toilet and bathing infrastructure design, and the need for good solid waste management. The sanitation needs of menstruating perimenopausal women can be addressed through adapting existing hardware and software solutions."

to manage their water resources in a sustainable manner. Anthropogenic Climate Change, land development, point source pollution and increased population have all combined to alter the water balance on these fragile islands. Karst features, shallow depth to groundwater and the potential for dissolution, contribute greatly to these challenges. Combined, these factors pose an array of complex research questions. Field implementation of a Freshwater Lens Assessment Protocol (FLAP) was initiated on Bantayan Island in August 2017. Field mapping, well surveying, groundwater sampling and laboratory analysis have been completed for the first quarter of the yearlong study. Through the application of current groundwater characterization practices the research posits a novel approach for these hydrogeological environs. Through applying FLAP credible output for the characterization of the islands groundwater resources will be determined and integrated into an Adaptive Water Resource Management framework, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions on sustainable abstraction strategies."

On the other hand same local NGO working at district and provincial level lack the capacity; specifically not having defined roles and responsibilities in responding to the specific needs of poor and disadvantaged communities (Badu, 2002). Chand (2001) has identified that local NGOs which are working and advocating in the sector like drinking water and sanitation requires robust organizational technical and management capacity. Due to the lack of capacity of local NGOs, INGOs and donors preferably work with other INGOs or civic groups formed by donors and communities (ADB, 2005). This situation leads to a vicious cycle where a local NGO having low organizational capacity is left behind without having an opportunity to partner with INGOs. This ultimately leads to limiting the prospects of having access to learning and sharing opportunities for their overall organizational growth and development. This paper intends to share the learning of partnership experience while working in COVID-19 Pandemic."

One of the objectives of the project was households using appropriate water treatment options. As a first step, households must have knowledge about the quality of water they are consuming. To facilitate this, simple, accessible & affordable quality testing services are essential. Water quality testing services at the local level ensure that community members understand the quality of their water, which then motivates them to use household water treatment options for safe drinking water."
